The initial version of this book was born as an exercise of pedagogy in a sector which was largely uncharted: private equity. I wrote then that it was the direct result of'my experience of reading the available literature and my recurring lack of satisfaction regarding their ability to combine so as to formulate an articulate theory'. I was obviously not the only one. The success of the abridged French version of this book (Demaria, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2018), of which the first edition as well as the updated reprints were each sold out within less than a year, tends to confirm it. The second edition was also translated into Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin, reaching an even wider public.

Things have changed. First, there are now multiple books on private equity, at times highly opinionated (Philippou, 2017). This is a positive development, as we all collectively need multiple sources of information of high quality. Many academics from different disciplines, as well as finance practitioners, have also tried to contribute to public enlightenment, often with considerable success. Highly acclaimed academics, such as Josh Lerner, Antoinette Schoar and Paul Gompers in the USA, or Per Stromberg, Tim Jenkinson and Douglas Cumming in Europe, are a few of a growing academic community extending our knowledge of this difficult and largely misunderstood part of a broader category of finance called 'alternative assets'. Private equity has benefitted from their efforts tremendously. There have also been honourable attempts to paint a portrait of private equity by famous and reputable practitioners, such as The Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW).

However, one of the recurring criticisms made notably to many academic works is that they often remain prisoners of ill-adapted theoretical frameworks. Using toolboxes designed for analysing quantitative data, these frameworks soon reveal their limitations. The discrepancies which can be observed between research by academic authors and empirical observations by practitioners are a testimony to their inadequacy. There are constant gaps between the findings of the former and the facts as reported by the latter. Multiple sources rehash outdated content (at times biased), trying to valiantly maintain an illusion of coherence - with some dogmas coming from the analysis of listed markets. Many concepts, such as efficient markets and the measure of risks through volatility, are inadapted. This should now be clear and acknowledged - notably as they are not even relevant for listed markets.

It is time to devise new instruments, a task long overdue. Private equity cannot be turned simply into equations as is done for hedge funds. It requires specific tools, for example to analyse its performance, risk and liquidity. Indeed, acknowledging that liquidity is not a risk but a variable of private equity investing and thus supporting specific analyses should now be straightforward. The consequences of this acceptation are that there are three dimensions to analyse systematically, instead of two. This notably changes the framework to analyse the source of value creation in private equity Introduction

**Not just 'equity'**

Stating that _'private equity' is (just) 'equity'_ is a mistake. From this assumption, it might also be assumed that private equity may be analysed validly with the tools used for public equities. This has so far been proven wrong: the timeframe, the risks, the skills required and the returns associated with private equity investments differ substantially from those associated with public equities.

The defining feature is the **value creation,** which is the result of the implementation of a plan by the management on behalf of the owner(s) of the company, also referred to as 'investor(s)'. A focus on value creation also applies to the more recent segments of the private markets universe, such as private debt and private real assets. Investors analyse companies and assets to assess their plans for development (or restructuring in specific cases). In the case of specific private debt strategies such as direct lending, although the 'governance' is structured through debt contracts, investors monitor the implementation of the plan and act in case of significant deviation from it.

**Not necessarily 'private'**

To implement this plan efficiently, the company benefits from being private. Some companies, such as Dell in 2013, can be delisted to undertake significant changes. In this example, Silver Lake Partners and Michael Dell acquired the company for USD 24.4 billion to take it private and launch a stream of acquisitions, such as EMC for USD 67 billion in 2015.

_Therefore, if it is not 'equity'_, _then 'private' could appear as defining the sector_. Once again, this has been proven wrong: although private, that is non-listed assets, companies and assets can implement plans more easily, some private equity investors also operate on the stock exchange. For example, in the case of a private investment in public entities (PIPE), investors inject significant capital in profitable and growing listed companies in what is usually described in private equity as 'growth capital'. Other investors execute their private equity investment with a listed structure, such as a Business Development Company (BDC) or Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).

The common and defining feature of these investments in private or public entities is their long **holding period**: the average 3 to 5 years during which the company is held by the investor in private equity. This is necessary to implement the plan referred to above to create value. This differentiates, for example, private equity investors from activist investors. The latter belong to the hedge fund world and borrow some of the tools from the private equity box to apply them to listed companies. Their holding periods are shorter than in private equity.

_More than private equity: the emergence of new 'private market' segments_

The criteria of value creation and long holding periods support the identification of additional segments in private markets. Private debt has long been in the shadow of private equity. After all, two of the oldest strategies in the book are focusing on convertible debt: mezzanine debt and distressed debt. They are 'quasi private equity', in a way. Mezzanine debt is often associated with the acquisition of a company through LBO, by providing some of the debt for that purpose. Distressed debt aims at acquiring the debt of an ailing company under bankruptcy procedures and taking control of it by converting this debt into equity. However, their risk-return profiles differ significantly from private equity strategies. The emergence of direct lending (also known as senior lending), consisting of financing companies through plain vanilla debt ('senior debt') without the intervention of a bank, gave a critical mass to the private debt sector. It is now on the radar of investors, along with mezzanine and distressed debt.

_A unique dynamic framework of analysis to capture a fast-paced evolution_

The second reason why this book differs from the rest lies in its approach to private equity financing as a cycle, and not a static body of financial practices. Two factors motivate this approach:

* _Private equity has been attracting an ever increasing amount of capital_ over the course of the last three decades (from roughly USD 100 billion under management in 1990 to USD 3 trillion in 2018, according to Preqin).7 This capital inflow has contributed to changing the dynamics of the sector, its structure, its practices and its influence on the overall economy over the course of only six to seven business cycles (that is to say, on average 3 years of economic growth and 2 years of recession). The source of this inflow, notably pension funds, has also exposed the private equity sector to exogenous influences as its visibility has increased (we will of course come back to this later). Footnote 7: According to the same source, the assets under management of private markets (‘private capital’ for Preqin) reached USD 4 trillion as of end 2018. These figures are merely global estimates and essentially gather amounts managed by funds. Footnote 8: I’m not an investment banker, and bought this to get an insight into Private Equity [PE] to approach potential investors to buy a business. For me, this book was very insightful, and it had loads and loads of information. The guy gives you all kinds of trends and comparisons between PE & other investments in graphs and numbers, and this will help you loads if you’re in PE sales or business brokerage, for it definitely gives you excellent tools to approach potential investors, especially ones who might doubt the PE field after the last crisis. Sometimes it gets too detailed in comparing the US’s PE with Europe’s PE, and sometimes you might get lost, but you definitely can’t go wrong with this book. Great book.’ Amazon.com, Comment Mazahreh, 17/10/2010.
* _Private equity players are constantly innovating and at a fast pace_. This innovation potentially explains the persisting gaps between the academic literature and the daily activities of practitioners, as the scientific body struggles to catch up with the pace of innovation. Unfortunately, the lack of available data does not help the work of the scientific community.

Because private equity is evolving constantly and rapidly, it can only be captured partially by a single book. For that reason, dear reader, this book will focus on identified trends and on practical and theoretical dialogue; and it will draw some hypotheses to guide you towards an understanding of upcoming events.

_This third edition integrates feedback_

I encourage feedback in that regard. This third edition takes into account the comments that I have gathered directly - or indirectly. Some readers have expressed their satisfaction8 (seven out of ten comments on the Amazon website, when the two editions are combined). Others asked for further reading suggestions.9 Even though this book offers a Bibliography, I include references in the text leading to specific material, helping readers to deepen their knowledge in certain areas.

One of the criticisms of the book has been its emphasis on historical perspectives and the lack of business cases and practical elements.10 Indeed, Chapters 1 and 2 draw conclusions from past experiences - and some readers loved it.11 One of the most interesting books about venture capital (Lerner, 2009) is actually purely built on past experiences and the reasons for their successes and failures. My initial idea was to underline what helped to shape a vivid private equity environment, and what are the prerequisites for finding it in a given region or country. However, I did not explicitly state this. I hence added elements about emerging markets (and how they match this background) to put the history in perspective. The addition of private debt and private real assets to this third edition is the vindication that this historical approach was not only interesting, but necessary. Thanks to it, it is possible to understand the emergence of these two sectors, in the footsteps of private equity, that is out of a long series of public-private partnerships.

Footnote 10:... but no in depth information on how to form or run a private equity [sic]’, Amazon.com, Comment Brandon Dean, 11/5/2011.

Footnote 11: “This is an ambitious and much needed book, but could be better executed. In its first chapters, Introduction to Private Equity helps the newcomer get his/her head around the concept of private equity. The first chapter is the best: through the example of Christopher Columbus, the reader builds a basic intuition for private equity. From this lofty and creative beginning, the next chapters describe the basic structure of limited partners, general partners, and companies. It also describes the basic categories of venture, growth, and LBOs. Simple graphs and light-hearted cartoons reinforce concepts [...].’ Amazon.com, Comment Shouvik Banerjee, 18/4/2011.

However, the subsequent five chapters and the conclusion are not about history, but rather document and debate the state of the private equity market. To try to increase the reader's satisfaction, I have co-developed with Rafael Sasso a business case about a private equity investment in a listed company based in an emerging market (Kroton Educacional SA) by a major private equity investment firm (Advent International). I have also added, as much as possible, documents which can be operationally used to raise money from private equity funds, or to form funds.

Cartoons have either been praised12 or heavily criticised13 by readers as a mere distraction. To please more conservative readers, I have removed them (hence promoting the first edition to 'collector' status).

Footnote 13: Amazon.com, Comment Iosnits Akkizidis, 22/9/2010; Comment Andreas Jak, 12/7/2010; Comment Shouvik Banerjee, 18/4/2011.

My writing style seems to polarise the readership: some readers like it,14 others do not.15 I decided to stick with it. First, changing it could be very artificial, and hence make the experience of reading this book painful. Then, because the criticism of not being structured around 'clear and concise arguments, and a math-like structure16 is precisely what motivates this book: it _cannot_ be structured in a maths-like argumentation (see points 1 and 2 above). As for a lack of clear and concise arguments, I believe that this book is actually quite factual given the lack of information already highlighted (see point 2 above).

# What are Private Equity, Private Delft and Private Real Assets?

###### Abstract

Theof the collateral is high enough to cover the debt, the interests due and the cost of the procedure.1

Footnote 1: For example, in Spain there has been a debate since, after the 2007–2009 crisis, loans are not covered if assets have depreciated. Thus, borrowers have lost their assets pledged as collateral and still owe money to the banks.

If neither the stock exchange nor banks finance business creation and development, then who, or what, does? Where does the money come from to finance the transmission or take-over of family companies, for example? Or to restructure an ailing business? To help a business further focus and optimise its operations and financial structure? From 'private markets' for that matter, that is to say, 'private equity', 'private debt' and 'private real assets'.

Private equity supports companies at every stage of their development, from inception (seed capital), to early-, mid- and late-stage development (venture capital), growth (growth capital), transfer of ownership (LBO) and restructuring (turn-around capital). Interestingly, banks were some of the first institutions to engage in this type of activity through their'merchant banking' activities.

Private debt finances companies where banks do not. Lending is actually being reshaped. This movement started with the switch in the USA from an economy essentially supported by banks to an economy supported by financial markets.2 It has slowly permeated other countries, notably in Europe. Under the pressure of regulations (such as the Basel III Agreements), and as a consequence of the last financial crisis, banks have been retreating from specific financing operations, such as lending to small and medium-sized businesses. This has paved the way for the rise of 'non-bank finance companies': direct lending. If companies engage in operations which cannot be scored or which go beyond the usual daily activity, they have to resort to this type of financing. Some projects, such as mergers and acquisitions, require more flexible forms of financing than a standard loan. Subordinated debt, such as mezzanine financing, can support this type of project. In specific jurisdictions, such as the USA and the UK, acquiring an ailing business to restructure it becomes easier under the bankruptcy procedure. This is the purpose of distressed debt investing.

Footnote 2: According to _The Economist_ (15 December 2012), in the USA, banks are responsible for 25–30% of total lending. In Europe, 95% of total lending comes from commercial banks.

As companies had to refocus, they had not only to master the delicate equilibrium between equity and liabilities, but also work on the structure of their assets. They started to dispose of real estate, infrastructure, energy and other assets, sometimes to rent them back (in a sale-and-lease-back operation, for example). Management teams have often associated an asset-heavy balance sheet as a slow-moving target for more agile competitors. These assets represented a reserve of value that could be monetised to engage in acquisitions or to refocus the firm further. As these assets were sold to private real-asset specialists, dedicated strategies emerged to handle these assets in whatever shape and state, ranging from plain vanilla, or even trophy assets, to derelict ones.

Private equity represents the bulk of private markets, with 60% of the documented private market funds activity, private real assets representing 25% and private debt 15%. It will therefore be at the centre of this book, while addenda will be made whenever possible to include private debt and private real assets. We will therefore start by explaining private equity as an economic driver (Chapter 1), to then include its further developments (Chapter 2).

## Chapter 1 Private Equity as an Economic Driver

_An Historical Perspective_

_olumbus: scientist, entrepreneur and venture capitalist_

After 7 years of lobbying, Christopher Columbus convinced the Spanish monarchs (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile) to sponsor his trip towards the West. His 'elevator pitch' must have been the following: 'I want to open a new and shorter nautical route to the Indies in the West, defy the elements, make you become even more powerful and rich, and laugh at the Portuguese and their blocs on the Eastern routes.'

Columbus probably did not know at that stage that he was structuring a venture capital operation. But indeed he was, as his project combined these elements: it was an entrepreneurial venture financed by external investors, presented a high risk of failure, with a high return potential and barriers to entry protecting a competitive advantage.

These elements form, at various degrees, the common ground for all private equity deals (venture capital, growth capital, leveraged buy-out, etc.). Another element lies in the 'private' characteristics of the deal negotiated privately between the parties: before the advent of the stock exchange, each deal was on non-listed companies or projects.

Even though it is difficult to imagine whether, and how, Columbus did his risk-return calculation when assessing the viability of his project, we can assume that the risks borne by the operation were identified and that there was a plan to mitigate them - or at least light enough candles in church! The risks were high, but not unlimited (thus distinguishing his venture from pure gambling).

The prospect of reaching the Indies gave quite a good sense of what could have been the return on investment for the financial sponsors: the Spanish monarchs and the private investors from Genoa. Not only did the potential return exceed by far that which a conventional investment could provide, but the new route had a potentially disruptive impact on international commerce, giving the newborn unified Spanish Crown a much needed mercantile boost.

_Private equity has always existed...only in a different form than today_

This example illustrates the fact that private equity has always existed, in one form or another, throughout history. Examples of historical buy-outs are more difficult to identify, hence the focus of this chapter on venture capital. Buy-outs transfer majority

### 1.1 Pooling interests to identify and exploit sources of wealth

The fundamental objective of any rational investor is to increase his wealth.3 Private equity offers investors the opportunity to finance the development of private companies and benefit from their eventual success. Historically, the _raison d'etre_ of those companies has been to identify and control resources, thereby developing the wealth of venture promoters by appropriation.

Footnote 3: See the discussion in Section 2.1.1.

_Private equity operations require a sponsor_

The main financial sponsor might have been a political leader, who would legally and financially ease the preparation and the execution of the venture for the benefit of the Crown and himself. The control of resources and the conquest of land motivated the launch of exploration ventures (a). Companies were created to support political efforts,4 thereby guaranteeing the demand for their product in exchange for their participation in a public effort to build infrastructures, create a new market and more generally encourage commerce and the generation of wealth. They could leverage public action (b). Apparently, conflicts of interest did not ring any bells at that time.

Footnote 3: See the discussion in Section 2.1.1.

_Private equity operations are symbiotic with public initiatives_

Often, private investors were complementing this public initiative, convinced by the pitch made by a person combining technical competence and know-how, with a vision and genuine marketing talent. This person would be identified nowadays as an entrepreneur - or the precursor of televangelists, when the marketing presentation becomes a 7-year sermon, in the case of Columbus.

#### 1.1.1 Identify, Control and Exploit Resources

The quest to master time and space has given birth to pioneering public and private initiatives, bearing a substantial risk but also a potentially high reward. This reward was usually associated with the geographical discovery of new resources (land control) and/or effectiveness (new routes to the Indies, for example), allowing a better rotation of assets and improving the returns.

_High risk, bigh return potential_

Columbus's project supported a _substantially bigher risk_ than the equivalent and usual routes to the East. This project was deemed to be possible thanks to progress in navigation and mapping, and some other technical and engineering discoveries. In that respect, Columbus's expedition was emblematic of the technological trend, as well as being political, religious and scientific; all of which he mastered so as to present his project.

The risks taken by Columbus were of two different kinds:

1. Initial validation of theoretical assumptions, with substantial risks linked to the transition from a theoretical framework to an operational process.5 Columbus's prediction of the diameter of the Earth (3700 km instead of 40 000 km) proved wrong, but his venture was successful in the sense that he reached an unknown new continent. This kind of outcome (refocusing the'research and development (R&D) effort' towards a different outcome) occurs in start-up companies financed by venture capital even today. Hopefully, not all venture-backed companies have a CEO who under-evaluates the effort to be produced by a factor of 10. Footnote 5: Today, this would qualify as a transition from ‘research and development’ mode to ‘go to market’ mode.
2. Execution of the four successive trips, with the presence of favourable winds and currents, the correct calculation of the time spent at sea with embarked supplies, navigation hazards (storms), morale of the crew and other operational aspects. Operational risks are generally financed by later-stage venture capital and expansion investors.6 Footnote 6: This is an early illustration of a phenomenon that would become Johnson’s ‘10/10 Rule’ (Johnson, 2010): a decade to build a new platform, and a decade to find a mass audience (or exploitation).

For all of the above reasons, Columbus's project was _innovative_ in many respects. It was guided by ambition and a vision. It was designed to test concretely the validity of a certain number of theories, which would be of great reward if Columbus touched Indian ground after journeying to the West.

The _bigh return potential_ was related to Columbus's calculations, according to which the new nautical route could save a substantial amount of time (and risk) to reach the Indies, despite the Portuguese land bloc. The return potential would be earned not from the initial trip itself, but from opening a new route for future trips to gather expensive goods (mainly silk and spices) and bring them back to Europe.

Another key element was that this new nautical route would have paved the way to developing a number of other new ventures using the route to gain other valuable goods. Columbus's success would not have been a one-time pay-off, but the source of recurring and long-term income.

_A long-term investment, protected by a favourable legal environment_

The time horizon of the trip was calculated in months, which represents a _long-term investment_, and the pay-off would have been calculated in years. This represents another element that qualifies Columbus's trip to the West as a private equity project.

_Protection_ by the Spanish monarchs _of this advantage_, by giving a legal right to the private sponsors of the project to the use of this new route (the historical equivalent of the current 'barriers to entry' in a given market), was a crucial element of the evaluation of the return on investments. Columbus was promoted to the status of 'Admiral of the Seas' by the Spanish monarchs, and then to Governor once he succeeded in his venture. This meant that he just had to sit and wait for the profits to come, after making this initial breakthrough.

As an additional incentive, Columbus would have received a share of all the profits made via this nautical route. More specifically, Columbus asked, aside from the titles and an official charge, for a 10% share of the profits realised through the exploitation of the route to the West. He had option rights to acquire one-eighth of the shares of any commercial venture willing to use the nautical route that he had opened. This kind of financial incentive (percentage on profits realised and the equivalent of stock options; in private equity this incentive is called carried interest) is often used to reward the management of a company, should it reach a certain number of targets.

In that respect, the dispute about the reward to be granted by the monarchs of Spain to Columbus after his journeys, as well as the difficulty of providing a quick and easy return for the Genoese investors (as there was little gold to find on the Caribbean Islands), is another point comparable with typical private equity operations, an outcome different from that originally planned. Some disputes in recent years between creators and managers of Internet start-ups and their financial backers prove that this still happens today - and, just like back then, in the courts.

_Pooling of resources_

This pooling of the energies and resources of an entrepreneur (Columbus), of Genoese private investors (representing 50% of the pool of money) and of the Spanish monarchs as a sponsor syndicate for the project is another criterion for its qualification as a private equity project. Its commercial purpose, even if not exclusive in this example, is another.

_Still not a template for modern venture capital...but not too far from it_

Columbus's venture, however, stands out as different from a typical private equity investment. He benefitted from political and legal support that would not be sustainable in an open and fair trade market today - or at least not so openly provided.

However, national states are still largely involved today in venture capital. Fundamental research is largely financed by public sources (Mazzucato, 2015), notably for military purposes. Moreover, applications of this fundamental research are also funded by public contracts for start-ups. The US Small Business Act of 1958 is an example, reserving a proportion of public procurement to small and mid-sized businesses. These start-ups can also be financed by public funding, either indirectly or directly. Indirectly, the European Investment Fund invests public funds in venture capital funds. At the federal level, the USA invested in Small Business Investment Corporations dedicated to finance small and mid-sized non-listed companies. Equivalent programmes have been set up in the UK, France and other countries. Directly, In-Q-Tel is a not-for-profit venture capital fund notably funded by the Central Intelligence Agency in the USA. Other countries such as France, or regions such as Belgium's Wallonia, have direct investment programmes in non-listed firms.

The Italian investors were 'hands off' in the project. However, Columbus convinced them and enrolled the providers of the three ships in his venture. This implies that even if there was no equivalent of a 'lead investor' and 'investment managers' (see Chapter 2) to look after Columbus's project, the monitoring was done according to historical standards, that is to say: on site, day-to-day and probably with vigorous debates about the option of continuing and taking the risk of wreckage or worse; or returning and saving both fleet and crew.

With partnerships, Mesopotamian families could _pool the necessary capital to fund a given venture_, _spreading the risk_. However, these ventures were not financed by equity investment. Capital infusion mostly took the form of loans, which were sometimes secured by the pledge of a man's entire estate, with his wife and children considered a part of it. If he defaulted on payments, his family would be sold into slavery to pay his debts (Brown, 1995). Lending to support risky ventures with significant collateral was still current practice as recently as the 16th century, as described by Shakespeare in _The Merchant of Venice_ (where the borrower/venturer puts a pound of his flesh, in effect a portion of his heart, as collateral to the loan). This was the equivalent of what private debt could finance today, although with different collateral.

In that respect, the Code of Hammurabi initiated the distinction between the entrepreneur and the financier, with the distinction between equity and debt, the creation of collateral for the debt and the privileges attached to loans (such as priority of reimbursement in the case of liquidation of the company).

#### 1.1.2.3 The Transformation of Public Intervention: Infrastructure Financing

However, this legal and tax support may not have been sufficient for the emergence of private equity. Besides law, other public actions are usually geared to helping entrepreneurs, directly or indirectly, and create favourable conditions that nurture the creation of companies. However, as mentioned by Lerner (2009): 'for each effective government intervention, there have been dozens, even hundreds, of failures, where substantial public expenditures bore no fruit'. As a result, direct help, because of its cost to the public budget and the distortion in competition that it introduces, tends to be confined and to give way to a more indirect mode of intervention. This indirect mode of intervention had already been identified and used by Hammurabi, who, aside from being a military leader, invested in infrastructures in order to foster the prosperity of his empire.

During his reign, he personally supervised navigation and irrigation plans, stored grain against famine and lent money at no interest to stimulate commerce. Broad wealth distribution and better education improved standards of living and stimulated extra momentum in all branches of knowledge, including astronomy, medicine, mathematics, physics and philosophy (Durant, 1954). In that respect, the liberation of private energy and the symbiotic relationship between public and private investments greatly rewarded the King for his action. This interaction with the private sector might be a test for modern programmes: if the public initiative does not act as a catalyst or indirect support, then the programme might simply not be relevant.

Indeed, public initiatives and private equity financing are still acting in an intricate way in many respects, but the relations between these two spheres have evolved towards autonomy of the private real asset sector (in the specific case of infrastructure) and a more 'hands-off' approach in public intervention. As a result, public intervention is creating the backdrop for private equity, paving the way for a subtler interaction, combining contracting, incentives and soft regulations.

This does not necessarily lead to a frictionless cooperation. Norway provides a recent example. In 2011 and 2012, ExxonMobil, Total, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell sold their 48% stake in Glassled, a gas pipeline operator based in Norway, to a consortium of investors: Allianz, UBS, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Canada Pension

Thecould be used not just in mining but in many industrial settings. Using the steam engine meant that a factory could be located anywhere, not just close to water. Offering a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency (75% less consumption), the new design was retrofitted to almost all existing steam engines in the country.

_Serial entrepreneurs: a cultural or universal phenomenon?_

Another figure which has emerged over time is the'serial entrepreneur', an emblematic figure in the USA which has still to appear in the rest of the world. This is probably related to different cultural contexts and levels of social fluidity. Thomas Edison (1847-1931) invented and developed many important devices, such as the light bulb, the phonograph and the stock ticker. He patented the first machine to produce motion pictures and planned the first electricity distribution system to carry electricity to houses (Bunch & Hellemans, 2004). 'The Wizard of Menlo Park' was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production to the process of invention. One of the most prolific inventors, Edison held more than 1000 patents at one stage.

In 1878, Edison convinced several investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, Lord Rothschild and William Vanderbilt, to invest USD 300 000 in the creation of the Edison Electric Light (EEL) Co., and to fund his experiments with electric lighting in return for a share in the patents derived from his research. JP Morgan continued to support the growing company by acquiring shares and backing the company's merger with EEL's main competitor, the Thomson-Houston Electrical Company. This merger resulted in the creation of General Electric (Frederick Lewis, 1949).

Gompers, Kovner, Lerner and Scharfstein (2010) state that there is a persistence of performance in entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur who has already been'successful' (an initial public offering or take-over of his company has happened) has a 30% chance of succeeding (21% for an emerging entrepreneur and 22% for an entrepreneur who tried and failed).

They hence develop _specific skills, wibich are critical_. This is important, because some of these entrepreneurs will retire once their success is fulfilled (which is a net loss for the economy), and others will become business angels (see Chapter 4) and hence provide experience and expertise to other entrepreneurs (some sort of 'entrepreneur spill-over effect').

These repeat entrepreneurs have also developed a _reputation_, associated with success. That might be crucial as suppliers, clients and recruits would then be willing to do business with these successful entrepreneurs. Once again, this reputation might be 'portable' to start-ups which are financially supported by a successful entrepreneur turned business angel.

_Nursing ideas (laboratories) and nursing companies (incubator and entrepreneur-incidence (EIR) programmes)_

Not every entrepreneur is able to come up with an idea ready to be produced. Inventors and developers sometimes hatch their ideas in a laboratory and can develop them before spinning off, but most are developing new products and technologies in their garages or other more casual places. To help support their efforts, some venture capital funds have developed 'entrepreneur-in-residence programmes'. Once an idea has matured, investors can take an early lead on the development of the company and get a greater share in the company in exchange for their past efforts. Other companies provide 'incubators' or 'business accelerators'. EIR, incubator and business accelerator

They spend little on the ventures, sprinkling money and making a lot of investments, hoping for the best to come out of this pool. They also focus on fundraising and helping entrepreneurs polish their speeches to convince investors (the 'elevator pitch'), instead of thoroughly challenging their plans and ideas. Their value creation is therefore limited.

In fact, finding capital is only one of the challenges of entrepreneurs in a more comprehensive picture that starts with a self-assessment of their own capacities, delegation, business planning and then financing (Trinomics, 2018). Their main challenge is to communicate their innovation, spread the word on their vision and thus convince their partners (employees, managers, financial backers, bankers, clients, providers, etc.) that they are able to lead the company to the next stage and transform their young venture into a business success.

#### Converting Ventures into Business Successes

Value creation is closely related to innovation, but not exclusively. Indeed, there is value creation in leveraged buy-outs (LBOs) by boosting companies through a significant and durable increase of sales, operational improvements or some other area of company improvement.

However, innovation financing provides us with a template illustrating the logic behind private equity.

In order to be able to deliver a consistent and high level of returns, a private equity firm has to focus on value creation and develop specific expertise that is applied to a certain type of innovation (Guerrera & Politi, 2006). There is innovation either in the product or in the service companies deliver (innovation by destination); or else in the processes they engineer (innovation by processing); in the way they contribute to structure their market (strategy innovation); or in the way they are managed (financial and management innovation).

_Technological or managerial innovation: a basis for private equity_

In the process of mastering space and time, entrepreneurs have discovered breakthrough technologies and invented new ways of communication. The infant equivalent of venture capital was instrumental in financing the development and deployment of these new technologies. An example of this public action helping to convert innovation into business success lies in the support provided to Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) by the Medici family, and especially Cosimo de Medici.

Galileo's achievements included demonstrating that the velocities of falling bodies are not proportional to their weight; showing that the path of a projectile is a parabola; building the first astronomical telescope; coming up with the ideas behind Newton's laws of motion; and confirming the Copernican theory of the solar system. Galileo translated his scientific knowledge into various technologies. In 1598, Galileo developed a 'geometric and military compass' suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of computing quickly the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. In about 1606, Galileo designed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.

First, because the investor did not cash out from the company but rather adopted a long-term approach and was willing to stay in the company as long as possible (this approach is actually close to the approach of family offices, managing fortunes and businesses from an inter-generational perspective). This implies a perfect alignment of interests between the entrepreneur and the investor, which may not be the case nowadays, as investors usually sell their stake in companies after 3 to 5 years. Closed-end funds are usually created for 10 years, and they must manage to invest and divest from the companies within this timeframe (this will be developed and explained later in this book).

The fact that the company that Boulton and Watt created broke even after 10 years would not disqualify the company from being financed by private equity investors. Investors would probably sell their stake prior to that, either by listing the company (which is what happens for biotechnology companies - even if they are not profitable, for example) or by selling it to competitors, who would be able to generate economies of scale and benefit from the growth prospects of the company. What is unusual, however, is that the entrepreneur and the investor managed to focus on this venture without making a living out of it for a long time. The rule of risk diversification and the necessity to generate returns early would not allow an investor to invest 100% of his time in a given portfolio company, or wait for such a long time before getting a return.

This is probably because Boulton was investing his own money, and private equity investors today invest as professionals (fund managers) the money they have collected from third parties (fund investors). This is another source of possible misalignment of interests. The pressure from fund investors to generate stable and consistent returns above a certain threshold stems from the fact that these fund investors have to deliver a return to their shareholders (corporations), or be able to cash in at least under a certain time constraint, with a given risk-return profile (banks, insurers).

This pressure is then transmitted along the investment value chain to the fund and its managers. These managers have to deal with these constraints and thus exert pressure on the managers of companies to deliver the expected returns within a given timeframe. This pressure should, however, not be perceived as negative.

As seen with the historical examples, the fact that Columbus and Watt had some investors on their side also helped them to get results and stay focused on the outcome. The delicate equilibrium to be maintained between innovation and the strategy to go to market with this innovation is probably the key differentiator between aborted companies and successful but meteoric successes on the one hand; and long-standing and growing companies on the other. The investor must not only have genuine know-how and talent to support the entrepreneurs, but also challenge them and guide them towards the market. Even though big corporations have financial and technical know-how, very few have the expertise to nurture innovation and bring it to market. This means that private equity has its own specificities that are not only difficult to replicate, but also to copycat outside of a given ecosystem.

#### Entrepreneurship and Private Equity Form a Specific Ecosystem

The separation of the roles of entrepreneurs and investors, associated with the emergence of partnerships, has paved the way towards a better collaboration between the financial and the entrepreneurial worlds. Not every partnership was built under the same conditions as the template-like Watt-Boulton relationship. Most of the time, partnerships have to be established between entrepreneurs and investors who did not know each other prior to the contact, leading to a potential investment from the investor in the projected venture of the entrepreneur.

_Entrepreneurial and financial frictions: the exit scenario_

Aside from these conditions, the existence of _exit strategies_ from a given investment is crucial for professional investors. If an investor chooses to back an entrepreneur, he usually does it with a certain roadmap in mind. Entrepreneurs can afford to spend all the time necessary to lead a venture to succeed, their own expectations and the money available being the only limit. This means that, theoretically, an entrepreneur with a company generating positive income could continue to run it for a very long time (possibly until retirement).

Investors have a given timeframe to make an investment and get the return from it, as their activity is usually to generate profits and redistribute them. In that respect, the presence of an active private equity sector is determined by the existence of exit scenarios, that is to say, opportunities to sell investments to third parties. According to Bain (2019), based on Dealogic data, LBO funds recorded 1146 exits valued at USD 378 billion in 2018. This has to be compared to 1063 exits valued at USD 366 billion in 2018 (Bain, 2018). Figure 1 provides a perspective over time of exits for LBO funds worldwide.

Pitchbook (2019) states that for the USA alone, 1049 LBO exits accounted for USD 365 billion in 2018 and 1253 exits for USD 365 billion in 2017. As a matter of comparison, Pitchbook (2018) counted 1265 venture capital exits in 2017, valued at USD 67 billion in 2017.

Figure 1: Evolution and breakdown of global LBO-backed profitable exits, by value _Source:_ Bain (2019), based on Dealogic data. Excludes bankruptcies.

These exit scenarios are usually:

* A profitable trade sale of the investment to another company or private equity group (also known as'mergers and acquisitions' or'strategic acquisitions'). Trade sale is the main exit route in private equity, and usually represents 50-70% of all exits. As a matter of illustration, in 2017, Pitchbook (2018) counted 72.5% of profitable (that is excluding failures) venture capital exits as acquisitions by a third party. In some sectors this exit scenario may prove to be difficult, given the concentration of the number of players (antitrust regulations) or the nature of the sector (banks and insurers are sometimes barred from take-over by foreign players, and must comply with specific regulations preventing certain operations).
* A sale to another financial investor is the second most frequent scenario, representing around 15-25% of all exits. This happens in the case of an LBO following a previous one (a'secondary leveraged buy-out'), and increasingly from venture capitalists to LBO investors. In 2017, Pitchbook (2018) counted 18.5% of profitable venture capital exits as a sale to an LBO fund.
* A listing on the stock exchange, offering to the private equity investor the opportunity to sell his stake on the market. This stock exchange must exist, offering a minimum liquidity and attractive listing conditions, including adapted regulations. This exit route is less frequent and represents 10-20% of all exits. It represented 22.5% of profitable LBO exits in the USA in 2018 and 30% in 2017, according to Pitchbook (2019). It represented 9% of profitable venture capital exits in 2017 (Pitchbook, 2018).
* A sale to the management, which is rare as this means that the management must structure a private equity operation with its own capital (otherwise, this operation would fall within the trade sale scenario). This, however, could happen in the event that a venture-backed company becomes profitable. As it is debt free, the management could try to structure a management buy-out (MBO) to acquire the stake of the investors in the company, if no other exit scenario is offered.
* End of activity, bankruptcy or sale of remaining assets, thus a failure. This exit path is more common in venture capital than in other segments of the private equity market. This non-profitable type of exit accounts for 30-70% of venture capital exits overall. It is compensated by the fact that successes are also more rewarding in absolute terms. In LBOs, this represents 5-10% of all exits.

_The stock exchange: useful indicator, overbearing influence_

One of the first historical examples of a professional exit from a private equity-like operation was the introduction of the company created initially by Thomas Edison. In 1896, General Electric was one of the original 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average, and is the only one remaining from that time today. This listing allowed its investors to exit from their investments and realise a profit. However, this exit route is an exception as most of the exits in private equity are trade sales with longer holding periods for companies.

The rise of private equity as a financial tool for funding companies has been enabled by the growth of the stock exchange. Private equity could find not only an exit path for

Therefore, there is no hostile acquisition in private markets, even in the case of the delisting of a company. To access and generate the information, cooperation from the seller is necessary. The negotiation is a discovery process, which leads to adjustments to the price of the transaction. It is an ongoing process until the final transaction.

There are exceptions to this rule. It could be possible that multiple consortia of investors compete until the very end of an auction process, or of a start-up investment. Likewise, a hostile take-private could also potentially be possible. However, these remain exceptions to an established rule, which has different consequences in private equity, private debt and private real assets investing.

##### 1.3.1.1 In Equity: Preferred Returns and/or Increased Control over Decisions (Private Equity)

To address the increasing complexity of deal structuring and funding requirements, better master the risks inherent in their investments and calibrate the anticipated returns, private equity investors innovate constantly. Thanks to negotiated arm's-length transactions, investors can assess carefully and rather precisely their risks. Their investment may take the form of capital increases (venture capital, expansion capital), the replacement (leveraged buy-out) and even the reconstitution (turn-around capital) of the company's capital.

In venture and growth capital, investors negotiate specific rights for their investments with company managers, such as preferred returns and/or an increased control over decisions. These rights are negotiated in shareholders' agreements and grant investors such rights as additional voting rights attached to their shares, priority preferential profit, to match a predefined multiple of their initial investment in the event that the business is sold. They can also use other instruments such as stock options to achieve specific targets in terms of risk mitigation or return optimisation.

In transfer of ownership, whether of healthy companies through an LBO or of ailing ones through turn-around capital, the analysis of risks leads to the design of different instruments. In the case of LBOs, it is about fine-tuning the use of debt to acquire the company. For that purpose, investors execute scenarios to reach the optimal level and structure of debt. The aim is that the interests and the debt can be repaid thanks to the dividends paid by the acquired company, even in the advent of adverse conditions. This can also lead to the set-up of private insurance mechanisms ('warranties'), granted by the seller to the buyer of the company if a risk has been identified but cannot easily be mitigated. Warranties could also be applied in the case of the acquisition of an ailing company by a turn-around investor, although usually the price paid for the asset is the main variable of adjustment. In specific cases, the seller of the distressed business will in effect pay the buyer to take over the business.

##### 1.3.1.2 In Debt: Additional Cover for the Risks Intailed by the Investment (Private Debt)

Some investors prefer to reduce the relative risk of their investment, even if it means reducing their potential performance. This is how investment in convertible debt emerged, with less risk than an investment in pure equity: mezzanine debt is repaid _in fine_, often associated with options to convert them into the company's shares under certain conditions. This particular kind of debt is riskier than ordinary debt,since it is subordinated to the priority payment of other loans, so-called'senior' or 'junior','second lien' or subordinated by senior to the mezzanine debt. The payment of subordinated debt depends therefore on the complete success of the deal. This justifies a higher interest rate and the creditors' participation in the possible success of the business thanks to options to convert the debt into capital. Venture lending is the equivalent of mezzanine debt for venture capital and growth capital deals. It is quite common in the USA but still rare in Europe. Mezzanine debt is the counterpart of LBO investing, with theoretically a higher risk protection. Likewise, with venture debt and venture capital.

Distressed debt is another form of convertible debt. Investors acquire at a significant discount some of the debt of an ailing business undergoing a bankruptcy procedure. The intensive due diligence executed by the investors allows them to assess the value of the assets of this business. Thanks to this analysis, the investor is able to assess the worst-case scenario: the liquidation value of the business. If selling the assets of the company in the turn-around fails, the investor should be able to at least recoup his investment. The due diligence also supports business planning. The best-case scenario entails setting up a plan with the management of the firm, submitting it to the bankruptcy court and converting some of the debt into equity to take control of the firm. In the process, the previous owners are eliminated ('washed out') and the debt of the ailing business is reduced to a manageable level. Investors usually inject some cash into the business to support its restructuring. If the plan is successfully implemented, distressed debt investors can sell the business and make a profit. Distressed debt is the counterpart of turn-around capital, with supposedly higher risk protection.

Direct lending also implies negotiation at arm's length. The purpose is to finance operations that would normally not fall in the purview of banks. Investors actively assess the plan of the management and its chances of success. Unlike banks, which rely on a scoring system, direct lending investors apply the equivalent of a due diligence process. The information is often generated at the expense of the borrower, at the request of the investor. The duration, interest rate, amount of debt and covenants are tailored to each case and are the risk mitigation instrument used by the investor. The borrower is a healthy, profitable and growing company with a transformative approach. In that respect, direct lending is the counterpart of growth capital.

##### 1.3.1.3 To Acquire Assets: Combining Equity and Debt Instruments (Private Real Assets)

Many companies have been reducing the size of their balance sheet, and in the process sold assets. States have privatised real estate, infrastructures and natural resources. When assets change hands, it is at arm's length, as they require a careful analysis from the buyer. Some of these assets are plain vanilla: up to the highest standards, well maintained and requiring minimal management efforts. They still have to be assessed and priced. Others require more or less extensive improvements, a change of purpose (from office to residential use in real estate, for example) and other managerial efforts. The due diligence can be extensive and require multiple months of effort. Private real asset investors usually combine equity and debt instruments to acquire these assets, along the lines described before. The purpose is to combine variable levels of income and capital gain, the latter depending on the successful implementation of a transformation plan. Some investors specialise in providing private equity for real assets, and a few others private debt for real assets. The latter is a fairly small and recent activity.

#### Long Holding Period

Irrespective of which type of financial instrument is used, private equity investments are usually held for 3 to 7 years. Private debt investments range from 4 to 8 years. Private real-estate investments are held for 3 to 10 years or more. At the early stage of its investment in a given business, the private equity investor must evaluate when and how it will liquidate this investment. As we shall see in Chapter 4, this is due to a contractual requirement: funds are created for 10 (maximum 12) years.

#### 3.3 Imlying Specific and Significant Risks

These investments bear specific and significant risks (Chapter 3), as they target businesses and assets in special situations - such as creation or restructuring, for example. This is the intrinsic risk of each of the segments of this asset class. Furthermore, they are subject to the cyclical nature of private markets as an emerging asset class, and to the general business cycles.

#### 3.4 With High Expected Returns

As compensation for the risk borne by investors, return expectations are higher (Chapter 3) than those from comparable investments in listed securities.

#### 3.5 Undertaken on Behalf of Qualified Investors

Given the lifetime of a private equity fund (usually 10 years), the risk borne by this type of deal, the long holding period of investments and the need to diversify investment among several funds to apply a sound investment policy, the great majority of private market funds are subscribed by institutional investors, that is to say pension funds, insurance companies, banks or even endowments in the USA (Chapter 3).

#### 3.6 To Create Value by Implementing a Plan and Supporting Entreprene

There is no private market investment without a plan to significantly change a company or an asset and, most of the time, without entrepreneurs. In the case of private real assets investing, entrepreneur is more confined to project management, but there is still a creative undertaking associated with the set-up of a plan. As confirmed by Monitor Group (2010),11 entrepreneurship is first and foremost a local phenomenon. Accordingly, private markets investing is mostly a local activity.

Footnote 11: www.compete.monitor.com/App_Themes/MRCCorpSite_v1/DownloadFiles/NED_report_final.pdf.

Monitor Group notably states that public policies address with varying success the challenge of supporting entrepreneur. Actions range from cutting the administrative burden, to setting up incubators or improving access to venture capital. Nevertheless, a few topics remain neglected: promoting the entrepreneurial spirit (values, attitudes and motivation), developing skills, setting up a fully functional financing framework (seed investing and business angels, as well as IPOs) and taxes. The impact varies strongly, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1.2: Level of impact of public policies on entrepreneurship Source: Monitor Group (2010).

Entrepreneurship is one of the most powerful supports for economic growth and prosperity in a global modern economy. Few factors have as much impact on the emergence of innovation, job creation and the contribution to a dynamic and competitive economy as entrepreneurship. The 'creative destruction' described by Joseph Schumpeter is fuelled by waves of innovation driven by entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurship is the creation and management of new companies, often through the discovery of new opportunities or market needs on existing markets. Entrepreneurly leading to fast growth, transforming whole economies and industries, is specific. It is based on innovation, that is to say the successful commercialisation of products and services based on new ideas. It is driven by individuals gifted with specific competences, characteristics and capacities, as illustrated in Figure 3.

## Chapter 2 Modern Private Equity - A French Invention?

Human needs have increased and diversified throughout history. Public and private efforts have strived to answer these needs. Private efforts evolved substantially, notably with the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The latter gave birth to start-up companies. Some of these companies were financed by their founders ('bootstrapped'). Others collected capital from outside sources, notably from venture capital.

Venture capital itself became more formal as entrepreneur developed, with the launch of dedicated structures and funds. In the early stage of modern and formal venture capital, the entrepreneur, the investment manager and the investor emerged as clearly distinct figures. Modern venture capital, in particular, oversaw the differentiation between the capital provider (the investor) and the investment manager.

_The professionalisation of private equity investors_

By pushing the differentiation of roles further, the different actors of the venture capital industry paved the way for its professionalisation. Investors monitor and control investment managers. They essentially adopt a 'hands-off' approach, by delegating the work to the investment manager. Investment managers select ventures, designing plans with entrepreneurs, monitoring and controlling the investments. Entrepreneurs build the ventures, implement plans, structure and effectively run the companies.

Each venture is unique and entrepreneurs, to a large extent, learn by doing. This effort is a constantly renewed process, for each venture and each entrepreneur. Over time, investment managers accumulate knowledge by investing in different ventures. Their knowledge is a permanent feature that they can offer to help entrepreneurs. The extent of this knowledge can include changing the management of the companies they have invested in. To do this, they have to develop their own methodology and a philosophy of investment. This became possible as investors gave them the resources and opportunity to fully dedicate their time to venture investing.

Europeans were at the forefront of this initiative. Just as Columbus was a European individual discovering America, it was a European going to the USA who would formalise modern venture capital after World War II: the French General Georges Doriot. He initiated this effort in 1946 (Gupta, 2004). It was not a lone one: in 1945, the Bank of England and major British banks decided to form the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation to finance small and medium-sized companies. It then raised

Europe gave birth to multiple other scandals of this kind.

#### 2.1.1 The Strict Separation of Public Policies and Public Financing

To avoid further scandals, the application of public policies was separated from public financial backing, thus introducing controls in the management of public finances. This is the case, for example, in the creation of the War Finance Corporation in 1918 by the American Congress. Originally set up to support the war-related industries, the WFC was converted to support agricultural and railroad industries (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro & Wadecki, 2008).

1.2 The Separation of Public Endeavours and Private Efforts; the Subsequent Support of the Former for the Latter

This initiates the _tradition of public support to private companies which are serving a public interest_ (see notably Mazzucato, 2015). The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, set up in 1932 in the USA, is another example. The Second World War gave birth to another initiative. In 1942, Congress created the Small War Plants Corporation (SWPC), which, as its name states, was dedicated to small companies. This is the first initiative which recognised the _need to help entrepreneurs and small businesses for the sake of national and public interest_.

_This help was of a financial, educational and legal nature_. Not only did the SWPC set the trend for financing through loans to small businesses, but later the Office of Small Businesses also created educational programmes. During the Korean War, small businesses could apply for certification entitling them to participate in requests for proposals from the government. This paved the way for the creation of the Small Business Administration in 1953.

#### 2.1.3 Governmental Input: SBA, DARPA and ERISA

The creation of an _administration which was specifically formed to promote and protect the interests of small businesses_ is a manifestation of the early awareness of this category's importance for companies in the USA. Interestingly, one of the main activities of the SBA was to provide _educational programmes and financial assistance_ to entrepreneurs. In many respects, the administration placed the ability to grow businesses at the centre of its policy.

To support entrepreneurs further, and go beyond public support, Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) were created in 1958.1 This is the unofficial date of birth of the modern venture capital industry in the USA. Hence, 'the government played a critical role in shaping Silicon Valley', though 'with a "stop and start" pattern of

#### Universities, Defence and Disruptive Innovation

Doriot, a former member of the military, was teaching at Harvard and decided to set up his investment structure there in 1946. The _location_ had a _significant impact_ on the activity and success of ARD. Doriot chose the _USA_, where he had emigrated to, and not France, where he could have returned to. He then chose _Harvard_ to create ARD, and did not reproduce his initiative at INSEAD - the top European business school that he co-founded in 1957.

Indeed, ARD's best investment was a company created by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineers: the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). MIT and Harvard are located in the same Boston area, which helps to create a solid network of relations. DEC's IPO in 1970 was a landmark of what venture capital could achieve in the new technologies, having funded an emerging start-up and leading it towards the stock exchange.

_Doriot's legacy_

The success of Doriot's initiative lies in the development of the venture capital industry, fuelled notably by the stock exchange boom in the 1960s. Some teams, which were created by former ARD executives, could generate their own track record. In that respect, the _educational aspects of Doriot's approach and of the SBIC system_, as well as the strong ties to the university system, could give birth to an even more dynamic centre on the US West Coast, with Silicon Valley. The strength of Silicon Valley lies in its ties to local industry giants, which are more diversified than around Boston and less dependent on military contracts.

The _relationships between universities and venture capital are strong_, not only to feed VC firms with a strong and qualified deal flow, but also to invest in them. The alumni network is a very valuable asset that VC firms can tap into in order to expand their portfolio companies, recruit talent, evaluate opportunities, recommend investments and more generally provide a wealth of goodwill to the universities and their partners.

As _universities have contracts with the defence industry_, notably in R&D, VC firms are strongly connected to this sector as well. The US government has its own structure (In-Q-Tel), but VC firms are keen on financing _technologies which will eventually have a civil application_. The most advanced model in that respect is Israel. This country of 8.7 million inhabitants (as of 2017) counts 1212 investment structures active locally, with 162 funds and 8005 active high-tech companies according to the IVC Research Center in 2019. These companies are connected to the Israeli defence industry in many respects, notably in IT protection (e.g., Check Point Software Technologies, listed on the NASDAQ), communication (ICQ, acquired by AOL and then Mail.Ru Group), geo-localisation (Waze, acquired by Google), computer vision (Mileye, acquired by Intel) and semiconductors (Mellanox, acquired by NVIDIA).

The Israeli market is small and its local sources of financing remain limited. As a consequence, a specific Israeli VC model emerged. International treaties historically facilitated the transfer of Israeli start-ups to the American market. These companies were re-incorporated as local US companies once they had reached pilot/prototype mode. The strategy was then to invite US VC funds to finance the 'go-to-market' stageand eventually list the company on the NASDAQ, for example. US VC fund managers identified the opportunity to finance local start-ups early by opening an office in Israel, and sourcing local opportunities directly. They could then support their growth and development in the USA at a later stage.

_Public and private initiatives_ have propelled Israel ahead of innovation through _education_, and in the universities in particular. Promising students achieve a graduate degree, do their mandatory military service (where they can work over 2 to 3 years on high-level technology) and then return to civilian life with a significant theoretical and practical background. They are even allowed to keep the intellectual property of the innovations which they have developed while in the army. They are then ready to create a start-up, which is financed through the VC firms based in Tel Aviv.

Israel has the highest ratio of PhDs, engineers and scientists per person in the world - with very influential institutions in the IT sector and medical industries, such as Technion - the Israel Institute of Technology (_The Economist_, 2009). _Instead of replicating_ the American venture capital industry, _Israel has developed its own model_ and integrated it when needed in the American framework _to create synergies_. This is a radically different approach from the European perspective.

#### Challenges

Despite its successes, ARD was mainly the creation of one man and had to merge with Textron in 1972, when Doriot retired. This difficulty in managing the transition from the founding partners of a private equity fund manager to the next generation is a recurring problem in the private equity industry, which is largely dominated by individual personalities to this day. But in the case of ARD, it was also linked to a _structural rigidity_: ARD was still an old-fashioned structure in its legal organisation (Hsu & Kenney, 2004). There was no formal separation between the capital to invest and the capital spent on operations (which is very often the case for _evergreen_ holding companies; see Chapter 4). Corporate governance was greatly limited by corporate law, which is not designed adequately for controlling investments.

To address the inadequacy of the corporate structure, investment managers turned to the fund structure (Draper, 2011, Chapter 2), and notably the _limited partnership_, which was more attractive than a typical industrial holding structure for many reasons. First, the limited partnership _separated the capital providers (fund investors) and the capital managers (fund managers)_. Then, the limited partnership was setting a _limit to the life of the investment structure_ without forcing fund managers out of activity. The limited partnership was also _distributing profits_, which were _taxed differently_ - and particularly at a lower level than dividends. By separating investment management by the fund managers from capital provision by the funds, it was possible to audit the two structures on a stand-alone basis and check if management was done according to contractual fund regulations (the limited partnership agreement).

The 1960s supported the emergence of the venture capital industry. The boom of the US stock exchange supported this growth, confirming the success of VC investments. The same decade witnessed the emergence of the LBO industry. The take-over of the Orkin Exterminating Company, by Lewis Cullman and his team in 1964, was probably the first LBO in history (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro & Wadecki, 2008). Therefore, the modern private equity industry was born after the Second World War, and its growth was accelerated by a series of legal and regulatory changes, notably the liberalisation of the financial sector in the 1980s.

_The great American challenge: intellectual property laws_

Nevertheless, despite this rapid development, the private equity industry faces multiple challenges in the USA. Its legal and tax system is complicated and burdensome. The sanctions are difficult to predict and evaluate, notably for product liabilities through punitive damages. Its patenting system is a source of regular litigation which is holding back innovation, and also over-protecting patent holders.2

Footnote 2: This system has given birth to ‘patent trolls’, hoarding patents to sue companies which could infringe them. For the first time in US history, they filed in 2012 the majority (61%) of US patent lawsuits according to Colleen Chien, Law Professor at Santa Clara University, compared to 45% in 2011 and 23% in 2007. 35% of start-ups which have raised between USD 50 and 100 million have been sued on a patent, as well as 20% of those which have raised USD 20 to 50 million. The ratio of demands (some of them settled before reaching the lawsuit stage) to lawsuits runs between 100:1 and 307:1 (McBride, 2012).

Intellectual property is a major issue when it comes to innovation, investment and returns. It is especially difficult to strike the right balance between the reward of innovation and the excessive protection of minor improvements. Even worse, the patenting system can be used unfairly to protect a collective innovation or a technological element which is necessary for an industry and could later be used against an innovator. This can substantially decrease or annihilate the returns on investments.

Intellectual property rights do not create any value by themselves. They provide protection for the production of goods or services. The processing remains necessary in order to realise the investments made in intellectual property. In that respect, unused patents which are later activated in order to sue companies are a major problem when venture capitalists want to finance incremental innovation (which is their core activity).

_The increasing costs associated with starting up_

Another challenge which is associated with venture financing in the USA is the _increasing cost of building a start-up_. This is counter-intuitive, especially since the concept of 'lean start-up' (Ries, 2011) has given birth to a movement aiming to build rapidly and at low cost IT start-ups launching so-called'minimal viable products'. According to this movement, start-ups can then adjust their products (or services) based on the reception by clients and - if necessary - change their business model. The reality is, however, much more nuanced. First, this theory could only potentially be applicable to non-critical products and services. For example, medical technologies, infrastructure services and mission-critical software are not adapted to minimal viable products. Even if, in the short term, this approach appears less expensive, it can prove more expensive overall. Preparation and planning are expensive, but avoid loss of time and capital by testing. In an open environment, trying and testing means that competitors can learn from failed attempts. The start-up which did not succeed will require even more resources to deal with this legacy and catch up with the competition benefitting from spill-over effects, that is learning from the innovation of others.

Not only are fixed investments costly, whether in the short or mid term, but also variable expenses (office space, salaries, etc.). The centres of competence - such as Silicon Valley and the Boston area - are a determining factor in the success of start-ups,

of the _European Union_ (EU), and the perspective of a _pan-European market_, renewed the conviction that Europe could compete by applying locally a successful model from abroad. However, Europe diverges from the USA and Israel. Culture plays a major role in the process of innovation. Risk-prone populations in California and Israel cannot be compared to the somewhat more risk-averse populations in Europe.

This triggers two possible alternative conclusions. One alternative is that Europe may not need the equivalent of an American or Israeli'venture capital model'. Like Israel, Europe has a cost advantage in terms of talent and space, and it is also innovating. According to the 'Innobarometer 2016 - EU business innovation trends' report (European Commission, 2016; latest version available as of 2019), two-thirds of EU companies have introduced at least one innovation between January 2013 and February 2016: 40% introduced new or significantly improved goods or services, 34% new or significantly improved organisational methods; 33% new or significantly improved processes.

This is happening with the current organisation of the venture capital industry in Europe. Local venture capital firms are eagerly trying to spot opportunities. However, funds are merely built and invested on a national basis. This could trigger an issue in terms of efficient venture capital allocation on an EU scale. Given the role of venture capital in the growth of countries, this allocation is important in order to foster economic growth for the next 15 to 20 years.

The second alternative conclusion is, therefore, that Europe needs an organised pan-European venture capital industry. This remains to be carefully justified and proven. Assuming that it is so, the EU has to transform four specific local features into competitive assets, as Israel did for itself. The first feature is that the _risk aversion of its population_ differs from that in the USA and Israel. This has multiple consequences. One is that the resilience of start-ups might be higher, once entrepreneurs have launched, than in more entrepreneurial countries. Another is that European entrepreneurs might innovate in different parts of the international value chain, for example incrementally in business-to-business solutions. Major successes are often business-to-consumer companies which have been listed on the stock exchange. However, this is a very small proportion of the overall innovation of national economies. Instead of trying to 'disrupt' markets and compete head to head with Israeli and American start-ups, European entrepreneurs, but also other less visible ones such as the Japanese and South Koreans, might have adopted strategies and business models more symbiotic with the current economic environment. Capital needs might diverge significantly in that context, and require less venture capital.

The second feature is that Europe welcomes a _lower pool of immigrants creating start-ups_ than the USA. It cannot count on the integration of foreign entrepreneurs. Europe can, however, count on home-bred entrepreneurs, who constitute a significant cohort of talent. Nevertheless, immigrants in the USA were largely instrumental in leading the efforts of the country in business-to-consumer innovation.

This is notably due to the third feature, which is a fragmented European market. Despite the efforts undertaken to create an integrated and harmonised market, consumption habits, languages, regulations, borders and cultures limit the launch of pan-European products and services in a simple way. However, the USA also has a mosaic of state and local regulations and Israel does not have a large market either. Therefore, the lack of a true pan-European market is a limiting factor but cannot The first step is to select the candidate advantages as off-shore structures. In many respects, _European countries have set a specific tax framework for capital gains_, as well as a defined term in order to encourage investors to invest in venture capital firms.

Despite the adoption of the best legal practices from the USA, which is an unusual move on a European scale, the venture capital industry has only recently emerged as a significant private equity actor, able to attract international limited partners. The reason is that until 2000, the performance of American venture capital funds looked significantly more attractive than for European ones. The 2000 market crash, which chiefly affected IT start-ups and therefore the venture capital sector, reset the comparison. European venture capital managers gained rapidly in experience and expertise, and their returns are now fairly comparable (Figure 2.1). However, European venture capital funds still raise only a fraction of that gathered by American funds, thus triggering the recurring question of a potentially harmful imbalance for the European economy; or of a different model of financing.

_The double-edged impact of the pan-European common market_

The EU economic and financial union opened a larger market not only to local European companies with significantly lower barriers, but also to foreign companies with a local subsidiary. As local companies in Europe were cheaper than in the USA, and American start-ups were more often listed, fast-growth companies in the USA could buy their passport to the EU with very attractive conditions. Yahoo, eBay and other major companies emerged from the 1997-2003 cycle and entered the EU in this way. The same applied to VC investments. The first pan-European venture capital firms were coming from the USA and directed their main focus at late-stage investments, such as IDG Ventures, Benchmark Capital (now Balderton) and other famous general partners from Silicon Valley. One of the ways to learn the workings of the European markets

Thegenerate a significant multiple of investment, start-ups have to be capital efficient and target a limited number of national markets. This skews portfolio construction and the investment strategy of European venture capital investors.

Despite EU legal convergence, _national laws remain an entry barrier on the national markets_. Therefore, the start-ups target first and foremost their national markets (see Figure 2.2). One example is the patenting system, which is still very expensive and burdensome in the EU.5 Another example is the lack of common practices in corporate law, even though the European corporation (societas europaea, SE) has existed officially since 2001 and was adopted by member states progressively. However, the main reason for the slow growth of European companies is the problem of expanding sales into other European countries, the biggest challenge being the differences in language and culture.

Footnote 5: The system has, however, evolved significantly in 2012 towards a pan-European patenting system. Though the details are still in the making, the cost of patenting for a European protection could fall from EUR 36 000 to roughly EUR 5000 thanks to a mutual recognition of patents within the EU, and the restriction of the valid languages to three (see, among others, Barker, 2012).

Since Europe has a certain legacy, its innovating processes are the result of a common cultural background and national differences. A large part is hidden from the statistics and clear identification, notably because venture capital financing was for a long period of time the business of rich families (family offices), corporations, public finances (directly or indirectly), banks (directly or through captive structures) and not least, personal connections. Depending on the national specificities, and aside from the independent venture capital firms, some of the sources of financing dominate others: corporate venturing and family offices in Switzerland; public finances and corporations in France; banks and corporations in Germany; family offices and personal connections in Italy; family offices and corporations in Scandinavia, state and regional public bodies together with family offices in Spain, and so on.

enter this market. Another objection is that the corporation might apply a bureaucratic and burdensome reporting process to the start-up, akin to those applied to subsidiaries and business units, thus weighting down their agility and nimbleness while adding up costs.

Some corporations have therefore set up _corporate venturing programmes_ to maintain a foothold in the fields of innovation. Corporate venture capital (CVC) consists for corporations to invest in start-ups while keeping them at arm's length. Lerner (2009) has detailed the challenges when setting up such programmes and the motivations of corporations, which range from financial returns to exposure to new ideas and concepts, strategic alliances and generating opportunities for future acquisitions, once these start-ups are proven.

Some of these negative features associated with direct corporate investments still apply to CVC investments, notably in terms of reputational association and reporting requirements, but they are reduced. Start-ups accept CVC investments to fund them, and also because corporations are _crucial customers_ for start-ups in EU markets where access to public orders is difficult and means having 3 to 5 years of existence and profitable activity. If 56% of corporations in the EU won a contract of public procurement (see Figure 2.3), the value of these contracts would represent only 39% of the total value of public procurement between 2009 and 2011 (see Figure 2.4).

Even worse, the administration is highly averse to innovative products and services. This attitude is reducing the interest of start-ups in applying for the grant of such contracts (see Figure 2.5).

As a result, large corporations earn the lion's share of these public procurements (see Figures 2.3 and 2.4 below). Teaming up with large corporations can open access to

public procurements for start-ups. Large corporations are also usually _located in each and every significant national EU market_, which is very helpful for a small company setting foot abroad. Opening subsidiaries in the EU continental markets is complex, owing to the difficulty of opening bank accounts, setting up shop, understanding the legal and tax system, as well as local corporate and business practices. Having close partnerships with a large corporation is hence a factor of success in Europe, which may not be that important in the USA.

European start-ups have to adapt to the local innovation process, in each country, and in the EU overall. Either a start-up designs a product/service which is complementary to the business lines of a corporate giant, or its product/service is an input for a corporate giant. This means that in any case, the start-up will be active in the same sector as these corporations: for example, biopharma in Switzerland, infrastructures in France, mobile networks in Scandinavia, or services in the UK.

The industrial revolution in the information technologies area has changed the landscape slightly. Europe now benefits from high-quality telecommunications infrastructures, and the advent of the 'information age' has opened doors to start-ups willing to set up shop in their national countries despite the lack of obvious tradition and expertise in that sector. The reason is that the IT industry has become the glue inside and between companies. Roger McNamee has summed up this perspective (AlwaysOn, 2005):

_The 1990s were characterized by three gigantic waves of applications, [tbat] every enterprise in the developed world adopted at the same time...We're now between big waves, with the next huge opportunity [coalescing] around enterprise web services that require creating best practices...People don't even know what the business processes are yet, so I think we're going to spend... money where it's mostly build rather than buy. As a consequence, that money gets fragmented and spread over this really wide array of things._

This opens up a _wide perspective for European start-ups_, as suddenly it is not the size that matters so much, but rather the ability to adapt to customers' needs and local specificities. In fact, the impact of the IT revolution still varies widely from one industry to another. Information-intensive sectors, such as the travel industry, have been completely redesigned, with airlines reporting that 90% of their bookings are now done online. However, labour-intensive industries are still largely unaffected, but should be targeted by the next corporate and consumer IT trend. Pervasiveness, existing infrastructures to be leveraged and the need to automate business processes will probably spread IT further through the economy, creating new opportunities in traditional sectors while adapting IT to these sectors' needs. As a result, European venture capital will have its fair share of _challenging evaluations of investment opportunities_. The distinctions between industries will start to blur, and corporate giants are developing activities designed to adapt to this change. The difficulty for venture capitalists is to adjust to this change by financing those start-ups which can provide them with the necessary products and services, while going beyond a niche market.

Europe has imposed its _leadership in many industries_, such as automobiles and transport, aerospace and defence, and healthcare (see Figures 2.6 and 2.7). These industries are innovation intensive, but the output of the R&D tends to be less noticed by

They also require less venture capital investments. This can feed a general misconception of Europe as 'falling behind', with the USA outcompeting any nation bar China. In fact, China is still a smaller country in terms of innovation (see Figures 2.7 and 2.8). If the USA is indeed outcompeting in terms of ICT R&D expenses (Figure 2.6), this is less or not true in other industries.

Europe is leading the pack in various labour-intensive industries, such as transport, energy and healthcare, which are willing to integrate IT, organise the virtualisation of their production, differentiate themselves from their competitors and provide their customers with innovative products. Its core competence notably lies in _incremental innovation_, which increases the value of an existing product or service, following the pace of the national champions in their developments. Even though less visible, the incremental innovations are the source of regular and long-term economic growth. This competence in incremental innovation could explain why Europe has caught up with the USA in the domain of innovation (see Figure 2.9). Companies in the USA are less likely to have introduced new or significantly improved services between 2012 and 2015

when compared to those in the EU (32% vs 45%). This is also true for goods (23% vs 42%, see Figure 10), processes (17% vs 32%), organisational methods (26% vs 38%) and marketing strategies (26% vs 36%).

As a consequence, the compared risk-return profiles of American and European venture capital firms are relatively different. While American venture capital firms aim at realising some of their investments through an IPO, and hence focus on a limited number of start-ups, European venture capital firms are growing a larger panel of start-ups at a more moderate speed and try to avoid losses.

#### Challenges

In many respects, Europe has reached a first level of maturity in the professionalisation of its venture capital market. However, the situation is variable. The UK, France and Scandinavia are the most advanced markets, with active and numerous venture capital firms. Other markets lag behind (see Figure 11).

The challenge is hence a double one: offering a way for lagging markets to catch up with the most advanced markets; and developing a European platform in order to gain further competitive advantages and leadership in certain industries.

##### 2.2.3.1 A Fragmented Market: Obstacle or Asset?

Building an active European venture capital sector, notably in seed and late-stage financing, implies the lowering of the barriers of intervention at the late stage in order to build pan-European champions at a cost equivalent to American champions. As for seed investments, it is necessary to rely on national (or even local) initiatives as they are the closest to needs, with control of the cost of capital - notably when it comes to public financing.

However, fragmented markets can also be an advantage. Companies are partially protected up to a certain stage from competition by national barriers (language, law, etc.). Those able to colonise European markets are solid and have proven their ability to thrive in adversity. Fragmented markets are also a way to test the ability of the product

or service to fit the needs of very different customers. The difficulty for venture capital investors comes from the different staging of the financing of start-ups. Financing is quite linear in the USA, with increased sizes and increased valuations at each round, but Europe shows a different profile. National companies are deemed to follow the same trend, but will be rather less successful. Future pan-European or international companies need a second wave of financing rounds. This usually lengthens the holding period for initial investors (seed and early-stage rounds of financing) and dilutes their ownership (hence reducing their financial returns).

In many respects, the emergence of a true European venture capital market will be linked to an active direct secondary market. National investors should be allowed to exit when a company reaches a certain level of maturity, in order to preserve the viability of the venture capital value chain, without hampering the development of portfolio companies. Companies that were introduced to the stock exchange prematurely have had trouble with growing and succeeding. Allowing early investors to exit, while continuing to enlarge the company privately, is an important step to enable Europe to challenge the USA.

#### 2.2.3.2 A Strong Risk Aversion

The common conception about Europe is that it lacks the entrepreneurial spirit which characterises the USA. David Landes states that countries 'can build as many incubators as [they] like, but if only 3% of the population want to be entrepreneurs, as in Finland, [they] will have trouble creating an entrepreneurial economy' (_The Economist_, 2009). However, the situation may not be as obvious as common sense might dictate.

Finland is in the top five of the most innovation-friendly countries in the EU, according to the EU rankings (see Figure 2.12). The Finnish public authorities have thus built an environment which is adapted to their own citizens: Finland benefits from the most advanced entrepreneurial environment in Europe (see Figure 2.13). Analysing

Figure 2.11: Venture capital investments as a percentage of GDP, by location of the portfolio company

the success of a given country (e.g., Finland) by applying the criterion of the level of entrepreneurial activity may be misleading if this criterion is applied indiscriminately to each country without taking into account its specificities.

Put differently, the notion of success in entrepreneur may differ radically depending on the country, as much as the type of private equity investment strategy (see Table 2). It is not the case that a country is risk averse compared to another one, where its population does not want to take certain risks, but may be more eager to take others. As mentioned before, on the European continent, corporate venturing and the role of national champions (such as Nokia in Finland) determines the capacity of entrepreneurs to grow activities in symbiosis with their privileged partners. The size of markets also limits growth: meteoric successes such as in the USA are less likely to happen in economies with a few million citizens.

Moreover, European entrepreneurs may not want to grow their companies fast in order to sell them, but more slowly and durably to pass them on to the next generation. That implies there will be a path to sustainable growth which will be set by the owner-manager over the course of several decades, whereas in the USA it is more frequent that the owner-manager gives control to an external manager and eventually sells

Because the universities in the USA are highly regarded, foreigners want to graduate and launch a venture so as to capitalise on their knowledge and their own experience there. Foreigners will compensate for the lack of local knowledge and immigrants do not fear failure. Europe has therefore to increase its attractiveness, perhaps by setting a different focus. It could promote its public research, and perform a fair selection process based on the capability of the candidates, and not their money or ability to succeed in languages and pre-formatted tests. In many respects, immigrants dream of living 'the American dream' and work harder and take greater risks.

##### 2.2.3.4 What Will he the Next Source of Innovation in Europe?

Public and private research is determining the success of European venture capital. The _recurring lack of funding of universities' research_ is often mentioned as one of the main reasons for the lack of new ideas and ventures. This supposed lack of funding is mainly a myth. The amounts invested in R&D per country do not appear to be a major issue, as some European countries are leading the way in terms of the amounts spent on R&D (see Figure 2.14).

In fact, the most important factors are _bow this innovation is generated_ and, even more importantly, _bow it is spread across the economy_. For economies to grow through innovation, what matters is technology transfer. Fundamental and applied research needs relays to be transformed into innovative products and services. Venture capital is one of them, and enables entrepreneurs to bring theoretical and practical innovation to the merchant economy. Venture capital is combined with other relays between laboratories and project teams, such as technology transfer units within universities, and then from project teams to start-ups, such as incubators and accelerators.

European public research still lacks a systematic approach to technology transfer, though some progress has been made. The approach is largely bespoke and

possible to see that some countries have a better ability to transform innovation into ventures than others.

As a consequence, European innovation is largely incremental, business-to-business and focused. This is probably why Europe does not necessarily generate large business-to-consumer IT companies. It does have its own large companies such as SAP, Nokia, Ericsson, Dassault Systems and Sabre, but these companies essentially address business needs. There are exceptions, such as Net-a-Porter, Spotify and Skype (now part of Microsoft), but the focus largely remains on heavy technology adopted by corporate customers.

### 2.3 Conclusion: Emerging markets, building castles on sand?

In many respects, private markets are close to a 'gold rush' situation. Capital raised by private equity funds reached an all-time high in 2017 (see Figure 2.17), notably due to a significant increase in the amounts collected by private equity funds. Private equity funds collect roughly 50-60% of the total capital collected by private market funds; private real asset funds come next with 30-40%; private debt funds come last with 10-15%.

Note: the amounts in this figure do not match those in Figure 2.18, as Preqin appears to have restated the number of funds and amounts raised in its 2019 publication.

In the case of private equity, a smaller number of funds collected a larger aggregated amount (Figure 2.18). The average fund size has thus increased. The trend is driven by

and Indonesia (37th), but also South Korea (24th) and Australia (a developed market, ranked 7th in the IESE index).

Japan (5th in the IESE ranking7), South Korea and South Africa (36th in the IESE ranking), which are close to Europe in terms of legal and economic development, are still looking for the development of their own venture capital activity. Unfortunately, as demonstrated so far in this book, this is not know-how that can be exported, but needs to be grown locally through the nationally most active and innovative economic agents. As a result, the intentions of investors in terms of allocation to emerging markets remain fairly cautious (see Figure 2.21). The most attractive region is Asia (see Figure 2.22 and Table 2.3).

Footnote 6: The IESE ranking ([https://blog.iese.edu/vcopeindex/ranking/](https://blog.iese.edu/vcopeindex/ranking/)) provides insights about the attractiveness of different countries. The basis is 100 (USA), and the other countries are positioning themselves on the basis of different criteria against this reference. Though scoring can be criticised, as the USA is far from being the perfect place to invest in private equity, it shows how fund managers can expect to invest in other countries compared to the leading country in the sector. Comparison has its virtues, notably as this chapter and Chapter 1 are providing guidelines and background about how to build a viable sector. This is how each nation will be able to build a viable and long-lasting private equity ecosystem (see Part II).

Footnote 7: Despite a low entrepreneur level – see Karlin (2013) ([http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=3145](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=3145), last accessed 7 January 2013).

Following these conclusions, it is highly unlikely that private equity in European, African and Latin American emerging markets will grow into an established and professional activity (i.e., up to the standards of the USA and Europe) in less than a generation. It took 40 years for the USA to reach that result, and 30 for Europe to catch up. It looks very unlikely that emerging markets will achieve the same standards (notably legally and culturally) in less than two decades (at least).

Venture capital dominates the intentions of investors (70% for emerging markets-based investors and 64% for developed markets-based investors, according to Preqin, 2018b), followed by growth capital (67% and 42%, respectively) and buy-out (41% and 59%, respectively). The majority of investors plan to maintain their current allocation (58-64% depending on the location of fund investors), while 30-36% plan to increase it (Preqin, 2018b); 6-7% plan to decrease it.

_Current situation in emerging markets: the first boom - and bust?_

One could argue that emerging markets have been attracting a lot of attention and commitments, and have given birth to significant investments (see Table 3 above). This is not necessarily the proof that these markets are adequately structured and are working efficiently. As Lerner (2009) states about the Chinese venture capital sector: 'the boom in the late 1990s and the early 2000s was largely fuelled by investors in the United States and Western Europe, who were attracted to the tremendous growth potential of the Chinese market despite the immaturity of the sector and lack of experience of venture professionals.'

Hence, if the intervention of international investors is one of the structuring aspects of the building of a viable private equity sector (see Chapter 1), it can backfire. Power (2012) states that even if Asia continues to attract attention (18.8% of allocations of international investors in 2018, compared with 17.9% in 2010), it is because of high return expectations. There is a direct and strong link between historical returns and current exposure in emerging markets (see Figure 24).

Indeed, if the returns on investments are not up to expectations (see Table 4) because deal opportunities are fewer or too expensive (see Natarajan, 2012 for China),

Figure 23: Investors’ perspectives on the most attractive strategies in Asia

and exits are more difficult because the local IPO market has shut down (see Deng, 20129 for China), international investors (which are often regional, see Figure 2.25 for Asia) can shift their focus to a market rather fast (see Table 2.3).

ranking) has a strong level of political commitment in business, with red tape, lack of transparency and a high level of corruption. The country has received a lot of attention (notably regarding the set-up of local venture capital firms). However, Power (2012) states that a study from Pricewaterhouse-Coopers 'found a combination of corruption, government interference, and a lack of transparent financial information costs investors an average of 50 percent of the value of the deal'. Regulations are a maze, difficult to understand and the bureaucracy is unpredictable and difficult to handle (Knowledge@Wharton, 2011). The court system is weak and unreliable (Knowledge@Wharton, 2011). Fake accounting scandals have already been hitting China, and the innovation potential of local start-ups is deceptive. Local start-ups are often replicating innovation from abroad and adapting it to cater specifically to local needs (Bain, 2019). The Chinese government itself decided to tighten the rules on private equity investments (Bain, 2019), possibly to rein in what Bain describes as a 'bubble' (Bain, 2019). Aggregate capital raised by Chinese funds (including Taiwan) increased from roughly USD 30 billion in 2013 to USD 93 billion in 2017 (Preqin, 2018) and USD 13 billion in 2018 (Weiland, 2019).
* India (28th in the ISE ranking) has a democracy with nepotism, red tape and also a high level of corruption (see Kurian & Zachariah, 2012: 'India is possibly the least attractive of the emerging private equity markets', due to lower growth, poor corporate governance and bad returns). It has to deal with its regulations, tax regime and overall 'impossible government' (David Bonderman, TPG capital founder, quoted by Kurian & Zachariah, 2012). 'China may have similar woes but investors have seen profits there' (Rahul Basin, of Baring Private Equity Partners, quoted by Kurian & Zachariah, 2012). As a result, the country attracts between USD 1 (2014) and 3.6 (2017) billion, with an average around USD 2.3 billion every year (Preqin, 2019).

#### Latin America

Preqin (2018) counts 382 fund managers active in Latin America (including the Caribbean), and 184 local fund investors. On average, USD 4.7 billion was raised by 26 funds during the period 2008-2017 (see Figure 2.26 above). There was an average of 78 growth and buy-out deals done for an average amount of USD 4.1 billion between 2008 and 2017, and 113 deals in venture capital done for an average amount of USD 494.9 billion over the same period. According to a LAVCA and Cambridge Associates (2018) survey, Latin America was the second most attractive region after China, with 7% finding it not attractive and 64% attractive.

* Brazil appeared for a while as the main Latin American magnet for private market investments. According to EMPEA (2018), from USD 1.6 billion raised in 2006 by private market funds, the total reached USD 3.8 billion in 2008. 2009 saw a sharp reduction to USD 0.9 billion, followed by a strong rebound in 2010 (USD 3 billion raised) and 2011 (USD 7.3 billion). This was the peak. Since then, the country has suffered from a relative disaffection, notably due to macro-economic factors. Average amounts raised yearly are roughly USD 2.4 billion, with a minimum of USD 0.7 billion in 2016 and a maximum of USD 4.4 billion in 2014. Investments amounted

same difficulties), the lack of awareness of private equity from entrepreneurs12 and exits which remain difficult. Nevertheless, the Colombian government has launched a programme to promote and develop the sector in Colombia (Bancoldex Capital) and issued new regulations in 2018 to align private equity fund practices with international standards.13 According to a LAVCA and Cambridge Associates (2018) survey, 4% of respondents to a survey thought that the risk-return profile of Colombian private equity was getting worse, while 38% thought that it was improving. This made it the most attractive country of the region.

#### 2.3.3 Emerging Europe (CEE and CIS)

Preqin (2018b) counts 413 fund managers active in Emerging Europe, and 62 local fund investors. On average, USD 5.9 billion was raised by 25 funds during the period 2008-2017 (Figure 2.28). There was an average of 96 growth and buy-out deals done for an average amount of USD 4.6 billion between 2008 and 2017, and 141 deals in venture capital done for an average amount of USD 386.8 billion over the same period.

Figure 2.28: Fundraising in Emerging Europe (2003–2017)

* One of the most promising emerging markets is probably Central Europe, due notably to the convergence with EU law, the close connections with other EU economies and the development of an active private equity market. However, its slow growth brings it closer to Latin America than Asia in terms of attractiveness for fund investors, with average amounts raised between 2010 and 2018 of EUR 0.7 billion. Though entrepreneur lags behind Western Europe, exceptions such as Skype (based in Estonia but founded by a Swede and an Estonian) have promoted venture capital as a potentially winning strategy. Poland represents the largest private equity market in the region, usually followed by Hungary, Czech Republic and Romania. The Baltic countries regularly appear high as recipients of private equity investments.
* Russia is not spared by the critics (Primack, 2012). For David Rubenstein, it'may be attractive to visit as a tourist, but it's very difficult to make a lot of money there' (hence, the environment, legal, tax and political issues are criticised). Geopolitical and political tensions, notably between Russia and the USA, have further reduced the attractiveness of the country. Western sanctions on Russian representatives and companies have sent a signal to potential funds investors. The indictement by local Russian courts of an American national leading for Baring Vostok, one of the most established Russian private equity firms, has sent chilling signals in the private equity community. According to a LAVCA and Cambridge Associates (2018) survey, Turkey, Russia and CIS were the least attractive markets for private equity, with 19% of survey respondents seeing them as very unattractive, 39% as unattractive and 4% as attractive.

#### Africa and the Middle East

Preqin (2018b) counts 532 fund managers active in Africa and the Middle East, of which 73 are in North Africa, 202 in the Middle East and 257 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region counted 248 fund investors. On average, USD 1.9 billion was raised by 17 African funds during the period 2008-2017 (Figure 2.29). The figures were respectively USD 1.2 billion and 8 funds in the Middle East (Figure 2.30). There was an average of 77 growth and buy-out deals done locally between 2008 and 2017, and 42 deals in venture capital over the same period. In the Middle East, the figures were respectively 19 growth and buy-out deals with an average value of USD 577 million, and 25 venture capital deals with an average value of USD 148 million. The region struggles to attract attention. A LAVCA and Cambridge Associates (2018) survey shows that 49% of respondents find Sub-Saharan Africa not attractive and only 15% attractive. As for the Middle East and North Africa, the figures were respectively 42% and 9%.

There are multiple reasons for this disaffection. First, political influence and a volatile environment have not helped local private equity operators. Second, restrictions on ownership in some countries, as well as red tape and bureaucracy have also limited operations. Even if local GDP growth has often been strong for a prolonged period of time, a relative lack of investment opportunities and a difficult environment for exits have also restricted the development of private equity.

## Chapter 1 The Private Markets Ecosystem

### 1.1 Private Markets

Private markets have to be seen as an ecosystem. They are built on the interaction of fund investors and fund managers, the latter being in charge of deploying the capital in companies (Chapter 3). Private markets cover the cycle of development of companies, and provide solutions for all their activities (including in difficult times for example, Chapter 4). Focusing on private equity, at the core of the sector are human relationships and trust. The process of investing is based on building this trust and these human relationships, notably in dealing with information asymmetries (Chapter 5).

## Chapter 3 Private Markets

_A Business System Perspective_

We are all investors in private markets (see Section 3.1), even though not necessarily directly and consciously. Financial institutions ('institutional investors') collect money from each individual through various channels such as, for example, insurance premiums or pension savings (Davidoff, 2012). They redistribute this capital inflow in the financial system, and notably to non-listed companies.

The money invested is usually split and allocated between different categories of investment ('asset classes'), in order to benefit from the risk-return profile of each category of investment. The expectations of private market investors with regard to the risk and return of their commitments vary according to their industry of origin; the source of the money they invest; and their economic and regulatory constraints. For that reason, financial institutions are themselves not necessarily investing directly in private markets. They have delegated the management of their non-listed investments to professionals (agents), on their account (principals). Evaluating the performance of these fund managers can be tricky and sometimes corresponds more to a leap of faith than a scientific risk-return calculation (see Section 3.2).

### 3.1 WE ARE ALL INVESTORS IN PRINTE MARKETS

Institutions (such as banks, insurers and pension funds); companies; individuals and possibly other for-profit or non-profit organisations (such as endowments, foundations and associations) are the main sources of capital for private markets.

Non-institutional investors are high net worth individuals (HNWIs). These individuals, because of their personal wealth, are considered as informed and aware of the risks borne by the selection of private market funds. They can delegate the management of their assets partially or in total to private banks or family offices. These groups select funds for them.

Retail investors represent less than 10% of capital collected in Europe. They can invest in listed private equity vehicles ('evergreen' funds or holding companies) or funds specifically designed for retail investors, such as VCTs in the UK or FCPI and FIP in France. In the USA, private market funds are not accessible to retail investors. The only option is to invest directly (see Section 3.1.1.1) in private companies or through listed structures such as Business Development Companies (BDCs) or Special PurposeAquisition Companies (SPACs), which are in essence listed holding companies of private assets or companies.

For the purpose of this book, we will focus on institutional fund investors (i.e., insurance groups, pension funds and banks) that we will call at times 'limited partners' (LPs), and fund managers that we will call at times 'general partners' (GPs).

#### Sources of Capital

Sources of capital are split along three dimensions. First, investors can be _constrained_ by regulations or _unconstrained_. Insurance groups, pension funds and banks belong to the first category. Family offices, which manage the wealth of families, HNWIs, as well as companies, belong to the second category. In between are foundations and endowments, which are largely unconstrained investors, with an obligation to spend a certain amount of their gain every year to keep their tax-exempt situation. Governmental agencies and sovereign wealth funds being public entities, their constraints can be very variable.

Second, investors can delegate their investments or execute themselves. For example, insured individuals and future pensioners delegate their investments. HNWIs can delegate or execute their investments themselves, as mentioned above.

Third, investors can have access to the full spectrum of investment opportunities or not. In Figure 3.1, investors have access to funds of funds, funds and private companies, because regulations deem them sufficiently sophisticated. In practice, many investors do not invest directly in private companies, as this requires a high level of expertise and significant resources, and involves a significant level of risk.

Note: ‘PE’ refers to private equity, ‘VC’ refers to venture capital, ‘LBO’ refers to leveraged buy-out

_Source:_ Demaria (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012).

Investors have three main channels to invest directly or indirectly in non-listed companies (Figure 3.1): directly (Section 3.1.1.1), through funds (Section 3.1.1.2) and through funds of funds (Section 3.1.1.3).

Western institutional investors allocated 4.6% of their assets under management to private equity in 2007. This proportion fell back to 3% in 2009 and grew to 3.6% in 2011 (Russell Research, 2012). On average, European pension funds allocated 3.7% of their assets under management to private equity in 2010 according to Preqin. As of 2018, allocations ranged from 0.4% to 3% globally, depending on the type of investor, according to Preqin (Figure 3.2).

The main absents of this ranking are banks. Their prudential ratios1 ("Basel III ratios") are proving unfavourable to private equity. The same reasoning has been applied to insurance groups in Europe (Solvency II Directive). The method to compute their solvency ratios has increased the risk weighting associated with private markets investing. Over the course of the last decade, private markets have experienced a switch in sources of financing from banks and insurance groups to pension plans (see Introduction).

1.1 Direct Investments in Private Companies (thus Being at the Same Investment Level as Private Equity Funds)

Increasingly, investors, and notably retail investors (individuals), are tempted to invest their savings directly in non-listed companies (this trend is hence not reflected in the

through an LBO (see below for an illustration), the management of the company can be part of the investors' syndicate, sometimes for a significant amount and even at par with the financial investors. This is the case when the LBO is an MBO, that is to say when the team of the company is structuring the operation and has contacted investors to help them fund the operation. In some cases, an MBO is operated by the management alone. In that specific case, the MBO is 'unsponsored'. If a fund or a financial institution is involved, the MBO is'sponsored'.

Direct investments are probably the riskiest method of private equity investing, with prospects for the highest return. The rate of failure depends on the nature of the operation. Start-ups generally have a very high rate of mortality, whereas LBOs and growth capital are considered less risky.

#### 3.1.1.2 Invest in a Private Markets Fund

Private markets funds are created in order for investors to delegate investment management to professionals, fully dedicated to this task, who can theoretically identify the best opportunities, negotiate the best deals and help companies grow. Some 'generalist' funds offer investors the opportunity to cover most of the investment spectrum of private equity, with an 'all-in-one' logic. In that respect, managers invest in a combination of venture capital, expansion and LBO opportunities. Even though attractive at first sight, this strategy has been declining as it suffers from multiple hurdles.

Indeed, investing in private equity is a long-term process, where experience is gained patiently and expertise accumulated on the ground. Teams are often of limited size and the personal network of team members determines the success of the fund. This is why the best funds specialise in certain kinds of operations, such as in Europe: Index Ventures Partners in venture capital; CVC or EQT Partners for LBOs. Some funds even focus on industrial sectors: Francisco Partners focus on technological LBOs in the USA; Sequoia Capital focuses on IT venture capital (in the USA for its main VC fund). Being a generalist fund manager requires competing with a large panel of specialised fund managers, which is very difficult.

In Europe, funds can be pan-European, such as Accel Europe or Balderton Capital Europe for late-stage venture capital; Permira and BC Partners for large LBOs. However, given the specificities of local markets, teams often cover regional or local markets, such as Scottish Equity Partners focusing on venture capital in the UK; or MBO Partenaires dedicated to small buy-outs in France. Halder, in Germany, covers mid-market buy-outs for the German-speaking countries (i.e., Austria, Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland). Being a generalist fund requires an expensive infrastructure, with local offices and teams.

Some fund managers have developed a branding strategy, seeking to replicate a successful positioning abroad (Sequoia Israel, Sequoia China); or diversifying into other operations (Sequoia Growth Capital) than their traditional positioning. Other fund managers, such as Blackstone, Apollo, KKR or Carlyle, have converted themselves into 'private equity houses', to invest funds dedicated to real estate, hedging, infrastructure and private debt (see Figure 3.3 and _Financial Times_, 2010).

Pure players (i.e., those focused on venture capital or LBO) are riskier if they have a very narrow focus. To select them, the fund investor must have an intimate knowledge of the industry where the fund is active. This can prove very tricky, if the fund investor wants to invest in venture capital, covering environment, IT, biotechnologies and other specialised sectors. To establish expertise in all of these areas of investment, fund investors have to put in a significant amount of resources.

The difference between diversified funds and specialised funds is thus determined according to the amount to be invested by the fund investor and its investment strategy. Given the necessity to diversify between a minimum of at least 5 to 10 funds, if a fund investor does not have more than EUR 20 to 30 million to invest, it could be an adequate strategy to invest in diversified funds covering the full spectrum of private markets and thus diversify only the operational risk, leaving it to the fund manager to diversify industry- and sector-wise.

1.1.3 Invest in a Fund in Charge of Selecting the Top Specialised Private Market Funds (Funds of Funds)

Funds of funds (see Section 4.4.1) provide investors with access to shared expertise. They can theoretically diversify their investments geographically, gain access to top investment opportunities and benefit from the support of specialists in their private equity investments. Technically, funds of funds are at the border between private equity and asset management. HarbourVest and Partners Group, for example, offer fund of funds programmes to institutional investors.

Fund of funds programmes can include the opportunity for their investors to co-invest with the programme in private equity funds, and sometimes even in underlying direct investments. This grants investors access to opportunities at limited or lower cost, with the possibility for investors to tailor their risk exposure and possibly increase their return. However, funds of funds themselves add a layer of costs and fees.

Some intermediaries, called gatekeepers, select funds for investors and build specific programmes for them ('mandates' or'segregated accounts'). These gatekeepers can also manage funds of funds, but create segregated accounts for investors willing to invest EUR 2.5 million or above. These programmes are designed to provide a specific exposure to certain risks for the client. Hamilton Lane or Cambridge Associates are examples.

The main difference between fund of funds managers and gatekeepers is that the former are usually putting their own money into the product they manage (at least 1% of the fund size is committed by its manager - some fund of funds managers do not commit 1% of the size of their funds, however). Gatekeepers are pure advisors and thus their incentive is limited to a service provider's commitment to quality, and officially does not go to performance generation. However, as these advisors' mandates are usually renewed regularly, performance is taken into account in the renewal of the mandate.

#### 3.1.2 Private Equity Investment Rationale

Any investor willing to allocate part of their capital to private equity is doing so for two reasons: diversification and return enhancement.

_Volatility is irrelevant to measure risk_

Financial theory often measures risk as the volatility of the price of an asset. As private market assets are not listed, this means that price variations are far and apart. This means that either private markets are low-risk investments, or that volatility is irrelevant to measure the risk of investments. The temptation would be to'rebuild' the equivalent of a volatility of the price of private market assets. Some attempts have been made in this approach, by so-called 'desmoothing' private market prices. This is far from being convincing for multiple reasons.

First, this approach considers that the only way to approach investing is the framework developed for listed assets. This is not demonstrated. Listed assets offer a specific feature to investors: the ability to sell their assets fairly fast, assuming that there are buyers. This is often referred to as 'liquidity'. This feature fluctuates over time, depending on market conditions, and has a cost. One could argue that the standard framework is in fact private markets, with mandatory active investing and mid- to long-term horizons, and that stock exchanges are an exception on which assets are monitored, traded often and thus priced regularly.

The first step is to use the _tagtagging_ algorithm, which is a method to select the The results of the analysis are presented in Table 0.9.

of direct investments. This means that a Monte Carlo simulation is irrelevant in this context. This also means that only active investors can thrive: investing a lot in multiple companies will not revert to an obvious average, as there is none.

Funds are also not following a normal distribution. They are skewed towards higher returns, with a 'fat tail' on the right of multiple 1. This is a visible illustration of the ability of fund managers to create value and to limit losses. There is no fund generating an absolute loss. Funds of funds are theoretically tools for both diversification and improved portfolio returns, a rare occurrence in finance. However, they are not evolving as planned by Capital Dynamics. The reason might be the combination of three factors: the impact of fees, which are reducing the performance of funds of funds; a fund selection capability which is inferior to that described by Capital Dynamics; and a statistical effect related to the high number of underlying investments, which ultimately dilute the returns of high-performing funds.

Given the increase in transparency in private markets over time, the role of funds of funds has changed as we anticipated in previous editions of this book. The fact that fund managers' performance is increasingly known reduces their edge as savvy private market fund investors. Moreover, diversification can be achieved by fund investors alone, thanks to a better understanding of this asset class and the performance of fund managers. As funds of funds do not necessarily deliver a better-adjusted risk-return portfolio, they had to evolve or disappear (see Section 4.4.1). One of the main evolutions has been funds of funds co-investing directly in private companies with the funds they invest in. This reduces the weight of fees on the capital invested. It also provides them with the opportunity to overweight the potential winners among their underlying

investments. This assumes that funds of funds managers are able to access systematically and identify potential winners.

_Return enhancement: active ownership_

One of the most common mistakes made when assessing performance in private equity is to compare the evolution of listed securities indexes (DJIA, S&P 500, FTSE, etc.) with the median or average performance of private market funds. These comparisons, however tempting they may be, lead to considerable confusion, prejudicial to the understanding of private equity.

First, _listed securities indexes are based on an arbitrary selection of stocks_. They often include the securities of large companies which are sufficiently liquid. This is very different from private equity, which is a less liquid asset class (compared to the market in listed securities), financing mainly growing small and medium-sized businesses.

Second, _the indexes of listed securities are an anti-selection of securities_ - they are 'hands off'; that is, they are not managed actively. By contrast, private markets investing is based on the concept of 'hands-on' selection and management (which explains the structures exhibited in Table 3.1).

There is no passive management as such in private markets. However, mention should be made of listed private equity indexes, like those created by LPX or JP Morgan. On this basis, exchange traded funds (ETFs) were created. Investors can use passive management tools to target the underlying assets: a selection of listed fund management companies akin to banks or asset managers. They do not offer a direct and clear exposure to the wide array of private companies and assets owned by private market funds.

In fact, listed private equity stocks can serve as early indicators of upcoming venture capital and LBO bubbles. They are popular when markets peak and get disproportionately sanctioned when markets tank (see Figure 3.6). There are multiple reasons for this:

* Listed private equity stocks effectively provide access to intermediaries: fund managers. Their health relies on their ability to collect new funds and execute transactions. Most of the management fees collected are redistributed to their employees.
* These structures are less transparent than most of the listed structures, as their performance fees depend on the evolution of private companies and assets that are difficult to understand, and on which there is limited to no information.
* Information on these structures tends to be limited to the minimum set by regulations, which are designed for other types of businesses.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline  & **Venture capital** & **Mid-sized LBO** & **Large LBO** & **Fund of funds** \\ \hline Fund size & \(\epsilon\)100 million & \(\epsilon\)300 million & \(\epsilon\)3000 million & \(\epsilon\)500 million \\ Number of investments & 15–20 & 10–15 & 5–10 & \textgreater{}20 \\ Number of employees & 10 & 20 & 75 & 25 \\ Management fees & 2.5\% & 2.0\% & 1.5\% & 1.0\% \\ Management fee per employee & \(\epsilon\)250 000 & \(\epsilon\)300 000 & \(\epsilon\)600 000 & \(\epsilon\)200 000 \\ Management fees (per year) & \(\epsilon\)2.5 million & \(\epsilon\)6 million & \(\epsilon\)45 million & \(\epsilon\)5 million \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} _Source:_ Demaria and Pedergnana (2009, 2012).

\end{table}
Table 3.1: Structures of private equity funds * As they are fairly small structures, bundled with larger financial institutions in indexes, they are not specifically covered by analysts and are not well understood.
* They are thinly traded, because of their size, the lack of transparency and the fact that they are largely misunderstood.

Third, _market trends on the stock exchange remain largely independent of those in private equity_. Notably, the performance of stock pickers is known almost immediately, while that of private equity investors has to be computed and annualised after the sale of portfolio companies. This means that short-term analyses (below 3 to 5 years' horizon) are meaningless.

Finally, indexes do not reflect average market performance, but represent a proxy of it. It is tricky to compare the performance of an index with average private equity performance. Strictly speaking, a set of emblematic private equity transactions should be selected according to the criteria applied for stock exchange indexes and then compared with the latter. This would draw potentially fruitful comparisons, assuming that the selected private equity transactions could be a proxy for the private equity market's behaviour.

_Returns in private equity and their persistence_

There is nevertheless a method to compare the performance of private market funds with the performance of listed indexes: the Index Comparison Method (ICM), also more commonly referred to as Public Market Equivalent (PME). This method is explained further in Section 3.3. According to this method, private equity funds theoretically

_The nature of the fund investor and its performance_

The fact that fund investors exhibit, depending on their skillset and resources, an ability to generate outperformance thanks to their asset allocation (Swensen, 2009) and their fund manager selection (see Introduction) proves that the persistence of returns of fund managers remains a fundamental feature of private market investing. Looking at the underlying deals of LBO fund managers (only), Braun, Jenkinson and Stoff (2017) conclude that there is a persistence of returns due to features of specific fund managers, and that it has declined over time. They attribute this to the maturing of the LBO sector, the commoditisation of financial and operational engineering instruments used in this area, as well as the move of professionals between GPs (or forming new ones). They also state that the increasing level of auctions has wiped out a large portion of proprietary deal flow, as well as competition for deals that have led to increased valuations (and lower valuations as well as lower persistence).

Beyond that common-ground risk-return approach, each category of investor has its own criteria and expectations, which can differ substantially from one to another. The source of funds invested by LPs conditions the expected return and the volatility accepted. In that respect, _family offices, HNWIs, university endowments and foundations_ have an approach towards private equity which tends to target absolute returns. They thus tend to overweight venture capital in their asset allocation in private equity. HNWIs who have sector expertise and want to be involved in the underlying asset companies' life sometimes act as consultants, Board members or even executives.

Private equity is increasingly seen as a source of returns, which could help pension funds to balance their long-term liabilities. Indeed, academics (Lerner, Schoar & Wang, 2008) have stated that Ivy League American university endowments have generated a significant portion (roughly 45%) of their returns from private equity6 and hedge funds - though the study covers only 2002-2005. Yale and Harvard have allocated more than 15% of their assets under management to this asset class. They currently allocate more than 25% of their assets to private markets.

Footnote 6: This might be related to their strong connection with their alumni network. An illustration of the strength of this connection is visible at www.cbinsights.com/blog/venture-capital/university-entrepreneurship-report.

_Insurance groups_ take a different approach. The money they collect through insurance premiums may theoretically be recalled at any time to reimburse damages. Statistically, insurance groups estimate more or less - for a given instance of damage - which percentage of the sums collected will be called in a given year. They can infer how much can be invested in the short, mid and long term. To avoid swings in the premium they charge to insured people year on year, insurance groups have to keep a certain amount of money in their accounts (solvency ratios). They have developed expertise to retain potential gains in their balance sheet; mobilising them when a big event occurs requires a massive payout.

Not surprisingly, insurance groups like the bottom of the J in the 'J-curve' (see below), as this is a way to register immediate (even though theoretical) 'losses' and thus

For these investors, it is _difficult to beat the benchmark_ as they are technically influencing the market quite heavily every time they move. This is why they have focused their efforts on influencing the management of the companies they are investing in (notably on the stock exchange); adopted a proactive approach to climate change questions and corporate governance; and targeted alternative investments early on, in order to benefit from the high return potential that they can deliver.

In private markets, universal owners are important fund investors. They not only _provide a high level of capital_, but also play the _role of a signal_ to other investors: if CalPERS invests in a given fund, it is because this fund has been through the thorough due diligence procedures of the pension fund and is thus of a certain quality.

One of the questions that universal owners face in finance is that once a company enters their private markets portfolio, there is a high chance that it will then be transferred to another compartment of their portfolio (such as listed equities). Once a private equity fund, for example, divests one of its portfolio companies, there is a high likelihood that it will sell it to a listed company or list it on the stock exchange - where universal owners are also heavily involved financially.

As such, the permanence of these companies in the portfolio of universal investors is not necessarily a problem as long as they create value and continue to grow. As a matter of fact, _private market funds act as an accelerator of the rotation of financial assets_ in their portfolio.

The problem comes when private market funds adopt behaviours which are detrimental to other financial stakeholders, such as:

1. _Quick flips7_ (Henry & Thornton, 2006), which consist of LBO funds to buy a company with a high leverage, keep it in their portfolio for 1 to 2 years, and then resell it. The problem with this practice is that fund managers usually do not have the material time to create value. The _costs generated_ by the buy and sell strategy, _as well as the fees collected are not compensated by the value created_ - regardless of the profit that the fund generated itself. In that respect, for universal owners, this corresponds to an _improverishment_ as the reward for the fund manager does not correspond to value creation. _Universal owners, just like the economy, are net losers in that case. Footnote 7: See Winfrey (2012) and _Private Equity International_ (2012), illustrating the case of the acquisition of Norcast Wear Solutions in 2011 by Castle Harlan. The Swiss group Pala sold Norcast in 2011 to Castle Harlan in a secondary LBO for USD 190 million. Seven hours later, the business was sold to Bradken (an industrial conglomerate listed in Australia) for AUD 202 million (hence a USD 27 million profit for Castle Harlan). Pala sued Bradken and Castle Harlan. Bradken might, however, have had sound reason for using Castle Harlan as a finder (see Aidun & Dandeneau, 2005). _Leveraged recapitalisations_ (also referred to as '_dividend recaps_'), which consist of increasing the initial leverage of acquisition of a portfolio company by an LBO fund and distributing the difference between the new leverage and the old.

a write-off from the latter of USD 1.7 billion. A universal owner who owned eBay stocks and had been investing in a venture capital fund which financed Skype would not only have supported all the costs associated with venture capital investing, the cost of uncalled capital and the opportunity costs, but also the friction costs (investment banking fees) and the ultimate loss associated with the eBay excesses in the Skype acquisition.

Another example is the Vonage IPO (see General Conclusion, Chapter 8), where a universal owner who was invested in Vonage through a fund dedicated to primary issue investments and previously through a venture capital fund supporting the company would have seen a 90% write-off on the stock price. Here, in addition to all the costs listed before, the universal owner would have supported the IPO costs and possibly the mutual fund costs.

To justify these costs, LBO fund managers have to focus on real value creation and at a level which can justify all these opportunity and operational costs for fund investors. They also have to maximise the performance of their investments, which is not necessarily the case. According to Cao and Lerner (2006), most LBO fund managers sell their portfolio companies 6 to 12 months too early. The difference in performance is significant, because if the funds had kept these portfolio companies longer, they could have gained on average 18% more of the value of their investment. If the IRR of the fund could have decreased with the additional time spent holding the firm, the absolute performance would have been better and even greater for the fund investor, as it lowers the friction costs. In that respect, fund investors have to make a full cost analysis when they compare their venture/growth/turn-around capital fund investments with their LBO fund investments.

Under the crude light of this list of costs associated with investing along the equity value chain, a few conclusions come to mind. The first conclusion is that analysing the performance of private equity funds with only IRR and the multiple of investments (see Section 3.3.1) of these funds is pretty much irrelevant: _the value creation is what matters_. This can be assessed by the analysis of the performance of the asset after divestment and the analysis of the situation of the companies before and after each private equity investment.

The second conclusion is that _institutional investors should set a (realistic) return target for their investments in private equity_ and sanction not only the under-performance _but also the over-performance_ (notably IRR-wise). A high rate of rotation of assets can actually harm the overall returns of an institutional investor: it increases the cost of uncalled capital,8 the opportunity and friction costs. The return target should be calculated as a trade-off between the overall costs supported all along the investment chain by the universal investor and the extra return generated by each intervention.

Footnote 8: As explained below, private market funds deploy the capital they collected progressively, as investment opportunities arise. This means that some of the capital remains ‘uncalled’ until investments materialise. This uncalled capital bears some costs for fund investors, as it has to remain available at rather short notice and can only be invested in short-term money instruments bearing minimal interest, if any.

The third conclusion, which is counter-intuitive, is that _private markets funds should be designed to actually last longer_. Prior to the crisis, it took 7 years for a 

## Chapter 1 Introduction to Private equity, debt and real assets

The most common asset is the _cost of unacalled capital_ (cash management): once committed to a fund, the capital can be called at any time by the fund manager of a private market. The amount committed can meanwhile be technically deployed somewhere other than on the money market, but the lack of visibility on capital calls makes it difficult to properly time the rebalancing (and the corresponding sales on the public equity market, for example). Investors who have ventured to put the uncalled capital to work in hedge funds instead of money markets have suffered from dramatic liquidity issues during the 2007-2009 crisis.

Then come the _opportunity costs_: the fact that fund investors cannot plan the distribution from most private market funds means that some cash will stay idle (or on the money market) until it finds a new place. The fact that the amounts distributedin private equity, for example, are usually substantial magnifies the opportunity costs. This should notably be factored in when private equity funds show a high IRR and low multiple of investments: the rotation of assets is hence accelerated but not necessarily optimal for fund investors, who will see the benefit of this high IRR depleted by the lack of opportunities to reinvest it at the same level of return.

_Beyond risk and return: liquidity, the third dimension of private markets investing_

Private markets add another dimension to the usual risk-return arbitrage of asset selection: time/liquidity. The timeframes considered, the timing of investments and the weighting of venture capital, LBOs and other private equity strategies can significantly affect the overall performance (see Table 3.2) of private market investors.

However, for pension fund managers, the perspective is different. Given the long investment horizon of pension funds, longer time-to-liquidity horizons are not a risk, but merely the third dimension of the usual risk-return approach. Indeed, private equity has proven that its returns are less volatile than listed equity indexes (Figure 3.7). In that respect, the stock exchange presents an additional risk, compared to private equity returns, that has to be factored in according to the lessons of the 2007-2009 crisis.

One illustration of the consequences of this additional risk was the '_denominator effect_' that long-term investors had to face during 2008 and 2009. Long-term investors usually formulate their asset allocation as a percentage of their total assets under management. If the total of assets under management varies downwards (notably due to heavy discounts on the stock exchange), and private equity does not (due to the lower volatility of the asset class, as shown in Figure 3.7), then there is an apparent over-commitment to private equity ('the denominator effect').

Unless asset allocations are evaluated over 3 to 5 years, investors have then to divest to match their target allocation - or temporarily increase their private equity allocation (a strategy which was adopted by some US pension funds). The secondary market for stakes in private market funds is not large (about 8-10% of the total size of private market funds) and provides limited liquidity. Private market fund stakes are usually negotiated at a discount (between 10% and 30% of the net asset value of the fund) due to the lack of transparency of funds. Moreover, it is estimated that 6 to 7 years from

#### Private Equity Fund Managers are Financial Intermediaries

Private market funds are usually created for a 10-year lifespan, with some exceptions. In the case of private debt funds providing plain vanilla debt to corporations (direct lending), funds are usually created for 8 years. In the case of funds of funds, the lifespan is usually 13 years, and infrastructure funds last 15 years. These 10 years are then subdivided into an investment period (generally of 5 years,9 with a possible extension of 1 year) and a divestment period10 (the remaining 5 years, with a possible extension of 2 to 3 years). Funds are advised by the fund manager (a 'general partner' if it is a limited partnership, or a'management company' for other fund structures), which is comprised of the professionals ('principals') in charge of analyses and investment recommendations. The management team is hence permanent, whereas the funds are investment tools created for a pre-determined amount of time.

Footnote 9: It can be 3 years in the case of direct lending funds and funds of funds.

Footnote 10: Also referred to as ‘harvesting period’, at times.

The fund manager is usually the only one to have a legal personality, as the funds do not have it. This means that funds are tax transparent: they do not pay taxes. Fund investors pay taxes themselves on the potential profits made by the funds, assuming that they are not tax exempt. There are exceptions, for example if the management manager and the fund are blended in a single structure such as a holding company. Listed vehicles or Luxembourg SICARs are an example. Another is open-ended funds, also called 'evergreen'. These structures pay taxes, and fund investors have to compute those taxes, possibly claiming them back, in their operations.

The distinction between funds and fund managers provides a strict separation between analysis and reporting functions on the one hand, and investment functions on the other. The alignment of interests between the fund managers and fund investors is theoretically fostered by the contribution of the fund manager, being at least 1% of the fund size, and currently above 3% according to Preqin. The assumption that a contribution from the fund manager to the fund increases the alignment of interests with fund investors is widely debated, owing to the agency costs (Tirole, 2005). In particular, it is clear that fund managers can collect back their contribution to the fund thanks to significant management fees. A 1% contribution to a fund can usually be recouped in 6 to 9 months of activity. A contribution of 3% can be recouped in 9 to 24 months. Another source of alignment of interests lies in the set-up of a performance fee ('carried interest', see below).

Fund managers raise the capital for the funds that they create in one or multiple steps (a 'closing'). The number of closings varies from one to four or even five, depending on the track record of the fund manager, the quantity of capital sought, the level of appetite of fund investors and other specific factors related to the fundraising strategy of a fund manager. A fundraising period lasts from a few weeks to 18 or even 24 months. After a fund holds its final close, it does not admit new investors. Fund investors commit to the fund by signing a subscription agreement, a document materialising their adhesion to the fund regulations.

Fund investors have little or no room for negotiations, as fund managers usually do not want to change significantly the terms and conditions of the fund, nor their investment strategy. Fund investors own the fund and mandate the fund manager toThe first step is to use the 'no fault-to-fault' (no fault-to-fault)

#### 3.2.2 Incentives and Fees

Figure 3.8 provides an overall perspective of the cash flows for private market funds.

Fund investors and the fund manager commit capital to the fund. The sum of the commitments is the fund size.

The compensation of the fund manager is called a'management fee' and is paid by the fund for the services provided (advice, analyses, fund management and reporting). This fee is generally 1.25%11 to 2.5%12 per year for a direct investment fund (around 0.5-1% per year for a fund of funds), depending on the fund size. This fee is calculated on the fund size13 during the investment period, and usually on the NAV of the portfolio once the investment period has ended.

Footnote 11: For example, for funds exceeding USD 10 billion of funds size (committed capital).

Footnote 12: For example, for small funds of less than USD 50 million of funds size.

Footnote 13: The basis of calculation can vary, but is usually the committed capital (i.e., the fund size) or at times the capital invested during the investment period and the net asset value of the fund (i.e., the residual value of the fund) during the divestment period or at times on the committed capital with a declining scale. In the latter case, management fees decrease from 1.5% to 1.25% per year, then 1%, 0.75% and so on. Management fees are usually collected by the fund manager quarterly in advance.

The NAV of a fund is computed by the fund manager to provide fund investors with the best estimate possible of the value of the assets in the portfolio. This 'fair value'14 has to reflect realistically the current value of the assets as if they were to be sold as of date.

Figure 3.8: Cash flows of private market fundsThe International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (IPEV),15 defined and endorsed by major professional private equity associations, provide some guidance to fund managers on how to compute the value of the assets in a portfolio. As of December 2018, the IPEV define the following methods to value an asset: a market approach, using multiples of aggregates such as sales or EBIT(D)(A), industry valuation benchmarks or available market prices (also known as listed comparables); an income approach (discounted cash flows); and a replacement cost approach (net assets). The results have to be adjusted according to specific factors, such as the nature of the instruments used and the rights (such as veto, multiple votes and liquidation preferences) conferred by these instruments. In the EU, the valuation exercise has to be done independently either by a third party or within the fund manager by a department working independently.

Footnote 15: www.privateequityvaluation.com/.

Increasingly, management fees are debated, as they substantially dent the net results of fund investors. Some fund managers, such as Bain Capital, have started to offer different mechanisms - such as a lower management fee and higher carried interest (see next paragraph for a definition).16

Footnote 16: According to Primack (2012a), the three options available for limited partners in Bain Capital Fund XI were:

* An initial set-up cost, generally 1% of total fund size17 (at most). Footnote 17: This can go up to 3% for retail funds such as FPCI and FIP in France.
* Fund administrator and custodian fees, if applicable, generally 0.05-0.1% per year.
* Operational costs, which can vary substantially, and cover audit, legal and expertise fees, as well as due diligence expenses for new investments. Should these new investments not be materialised, these expenses are lost ('abort fees').

In order to align the interests between fund investors and fund managers, the latter are entitled to a performance fee called 'carried interest' (or 'carry') of generally 20%18 (5-10% for funds of funds) on the profit generated. Some fund managers have indexed their carried interest on the progression of certain performance metrics.

Footnote 18: Some fund managers charge lower carried interest, for example in senior debt or timberland. Some fund managers with the best performance charge 25% or even 30% of carried interest.

For example, if a fund does not generate an IRR higher than 10%, the carried interest is 0%; if the fund generates an IRR between 8% and 12.99%, the carried interest is 10%; if the IRR is between 13% and 16.99%, the carried interest is 15%; if the IRR is between 17% and 19.99%, the carried interest is 20%; if the IRR is between 20% and 24.99%, the carried interest is 25%; if the IRR is above 25%, the carried interest is 30%. This can lead to some biases, since the IRR as a metric is not immune to heavy criticism (see Section 3.3.1.219). The alternative would be to use multiples of investedcapital or a public market equivalent to set the thresholds and ensure the best alignment of interest.

However, to provide a guaranteed return for the risks taken by the investors, which are higher than the risks taken by the fund managers, it is a general business practice that fund investors are entitled to a preferred return rate ('hurdle rate') which usually varies between 6% and 8%. The pro-rata of this preferred return is then usually paid to the fund manager ('catch-up'), if the performance is sufficient and if the fund regulation plans for it. Beyond this, the allocation of performance is done along the rule defined by the carried interest.

Therefore, the sequence is as follows (see Figures 3.9-3.11): first, the capital is committed and invested. Then, the committed capital is fully repaid, and the hurdle rate is distributed to the fund investors (if the fund regulations planned it) - for example 8%, then the catch-up which is 25% of the hurdle rate20 and then 80% of performance to the fund investors and the carried interest of 20% to the fund managers. This sequence can be operated according to two different approaches: the European and the American waterfall.

Footnote 20: The catch-up rebalances the distribution to the fund manager. If the carried interest is 20%, it means that the fund manager should collect one-fifth of the profit of the fund. If the hurdle rate was fully distributed to the fund investors and the fund manager has to catch up with this distribution, the fund manager is entitled to collect one-quarter of the amount distributed as a hurdle rate. After the payment of the hurdle rate and the catch-up, the fund investors have been paid 8% and the fund manager 2%, which are respectively 80% and 20% of the sum distributed so far.

The European waterfall, which is adopted by more than 80% of funds worldwide, disposes that the sequence should be applied at the fund level. Before any profit is distributed to the fund manager, the fund manager has to fully repay the fund to fund investors, and the hurdle rate (if any) too. The advantage of this approach is that it is prudent and any profit distributed is acquired definitely. However, this means that the fund manager has to wait usually 6 years or more until the distribution of a catch-up (if any) and carried interest.

The American waterfall, which is adopted only by the very best fund managers who can impose it on fund investors, disposes that the sequence applies deal by deal. If an investment was sold, the fund manager has to repay the capital used for this investment, make sure that the hurdle rate is cleared and then distribute the profit along the lines of the carried interest clauses. This approach enables the fund manager to collect the carried interest earlier. However, it also implies that in the advent of a subsequent investment leading to a loss, the fund manager would have to repay the carried interest collected to compensate for the loss. This is the 'claw back' clause. The fund manager therefore has to make sure to keep enough of the carried interest collected from early divestments to repay any loss appearing later.

Figure 3.9 shows the composition of a fund at its creation. Usually, the fund manager commits 1% (sometimes more21), while fund investors commit the rest.

Footnote 21: According to industry statistics from Preqin and MJ Hudson, in 2018 the average was around 3% of the fund size, some teams providing 1% and others committing up to 15%.

Figure 3.10 shows the breakdown of the fund investment and expenses during the investment period. The fund pays fees to the management company and supports

## Chapter 3 Conclusion

In this thesis, we have presented a novel method for constructing theexpenses (audit, legal, etc.). This amount is thus not invested, unless a provision entitles the general partner to recycle part of the proceeds of the funds invested to reach 100% of the fund size as a total invested.

Figure 3.11 shows the breakdown of the fund repayment in the case of a European waterfall. As an example, we assume that the fund doubled its size (EUR 100 million), which means that the amount invested will generate enough profits to compensate for the burden of the fees and deliver EUR 100 million in profits.

Some fund managers are entitled to receive fees, commissions and other income paid by portfolio companies in relation to their active role in backing the management teams

of portfolio companies.22 Most of the fund regulations (limited partnership agreements) in Continental Europe provide that these fees are paid to the fund, in part23 or fully, and not the fund manager. Technically, the fund manager collects them and reduces proportionally the amount charged to the fund as management fees in what is known as a 'fee offset' mechanism. This is logical as the management team is de facto already paid for this service.

Footnote 22: However, this definition is particularly large and can encompass, for example, a private jet.

Footnote 23: Usually at least 80% of them, the rest going to the fund manager.

Whatever the treatment of these amounts, it is important that they are declared to the investors. Charging consulting or other fees to portfolio companies paves the way for conflicts of interest (see Section 3.2.3). Fee retrocessions may not be as widespread in American funds, but the tide might be changing. Already, some teams voluntarily retroceded these sums partially or in total. Regulators are increasingly favourable towards the idea of establishing clear rules as regards these fees. Since 2015, the SEC has been actively enforcing a strict interpretation of fund regulations24 when it comes to the payment of fees from portfolio companies to fund managers25 and their affiliates.26

WL Ross was fined USD 10.4 million in 2016 for failing to disclose certain fee allocation practices and THL Managers USD 5 million for the same reason in 2018. First Reserve Management was fined USD 3.5 million for failing to disclose conflicts of interest related to fees and expenses in 2016 and Yucaipa Master Manager USD 3 million for the same reason in 2018.

#### Conflicts of interest

The separation between funds and the fund manager offers, theoretically, a number of guarantees as to the initial good faith of the management team. However, the fund manager is not immune from conflicts of interest. Fund regulations set rules to minimise - and if possible avoid - such conflicts of interest.

The limited partnership agreement (LPA, see Template 2), which regulates the relations between limited partners (fund investors) and the general partner (fund manager), provides a basis for governance. Investors have, theoretically, the right to participate, up to a certain level, in the governance of the fund they have invested in. However, practically, most of the time investors have no say once they have signed the LPA. The rights of limited partners are hence merely bound to be informed by the general partner, usually on a quarterly basis, and with an audited annual report. An annual general meeting of the fund allows limited partners to obtain a more precise view of portfolio companies and the development of fund investments.

The fact that some fund managers keep the list of their investors confidential limits the exchange of information between investors and hence the practical exercise of governance rights. It is therefore important that investors are formally represented within the fund's governance mechanisms. However, their role is usually only to advise the fund manager, through an Advisory Board, about the resolution of potential conflicts of interest. Fund investors are not more active due to the nature of fund investing and the shield from responsibilities that funds provide to investors. It is necessary that the fund rules, written by the fund manager and negotiated with the investors, nevertheless provide a clear framework of practice and reporting. Regulators, such as the SEC in the USA and the European regulators in Europe, increasingly monitor private market fund regulations and ensure that they comply with general regulations, that they are effectively applied and that they respect a certain level of fairness.

The lack of transparency - even for fund investors - of private market funds has raised some questions, notably in the USA. The San Jose Mercury News has asked public pension funds to disclose the details of the performance of their private equity fund investments. This triggered a trial where the court ordered these public pension funds (such as CalPERS and MassPRIM) to comply with their disclosure duties and apply the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In effect, this unleashed a wave of publications and communications, which has significantly improved the public's information about private markets.

However, fund managers are resisting disclosure and transparency. They have been fairly successful so far, as private markets remain today a largely opaque world. Some fund managers, seeking to prevent any further publication of information as regards their portfolio, have excluded public pension funds and other fund investors potentially subject to FOIA provisions from their investors list. Their reasoning is that this legal decision may not be limited, in the future, to the disclosure of the aggregate performance of the fund. Courts may decide that it is mandatory to disclose information with regard to portfolio companies. Fund managers do not want to disclose such information and try to keep it as confidential as possible, notably to avoid giving an unfair advantage to the competitors of their portfolio companies, but also the potential buyers. This also keeps fund investors in the dark and limits their ability to benchmark funds.

So far, Europe and the rest of the world have not shown any movement towards mandatory disclosure. The disclosure debate has illustrated the difficulty of obtaining information, even as regards the performance of funds. This applies not only to investments and performance, but also to fees and compensation schemes.

The most frequent source of conflicts of interest concerns income to the fund manager where the fund investors are not participating (i.e., fees and costs, see above). Other sources of conflict of interest can be linked to:

* The _simultaneous management of multiple vintages of funds27_ ('parallel funds' treatment), which raises the question of the allocation of investment opportunities to this or that fund under management. This conflict of interest can be managed by establishing a priority as to the oldest vintage, or setting up a pro rata allocation for funds of the same vintage. Footnote 27: This conflict of interest is close to the one which arises when there are co-investment mechanisms: should the general partner allocate as a priority the amounts of the fund it manages to the investment opportunity, or should it offer the opportunity to the limited partners entitled to co-invest? At a fund of funds level, this conflict of interest arises when allocating portions of highly coveted private equity funds between mandates (or segregated accounts) managed for some limited partners, and funds of funds managed by the general partner.

* _Reinvestment in a portfolio company already belonging to a fund_ managed by a given fund manager. Other funds managed by this fund manager may be considered 'natural investors', as this fund manager knows the company and has done the investment work already. This is called 'cross investment' in venture capital (subsequent rounds of investments) and 'deal recycling' in LBOs (when a fund sells a company to another fund), and could lead to favouring one group of fund investors or another. The valuation of the company would be decided by the fund manager who is at the same time on the seller side with one fund and on the buyer side with another. This is why cross investments and deal recycling are generally excluded in fund regulations (LPAs).
* The _maximisation of the revenues_ derived from the management of the fund and its portfolio companies. For example, companies with no real chances of success ('zombie' companies) can be held in the portfolio to maximise the management fees in the divestment period (which are generally indexed on the residual value of the fund), or to charge additional fees.
* even though it is audited. In that respect, auditors certify the method used, not the end result. Even if some private equity associations encourage the adoption of the fair market value (see above) as a reference to establish NAVs, some fund managers have decided to stick to the historical costs method, at times with good reason. The historical cost is deemed more conservative and less volatile, but also potentially less accurate. This approach might be more relevant for start-ups, distressed businesses and unusual situations. In order to preserve fund investors' interests, the European AIFM Directive has set the rule that a third party should produce a valuation of the portfolio of private equity funds (see above). Whether this rule will clarify the situation and improve the fund investors' information remains to be proven.28 Footnote 28: As a matter of fact, most of the fund managers apply different valuation techniques to comply with the requests of the wide range of their fund investors. Some fund managers provide a ‘conservative view’, a ‘fair view’ or a ‘best estimate’ and their own expected outcome (or high end value) for the fund’s portfolio. This blurs even more the picture of the valuation of funds. As the quarterly and annual reports are the main communication channel between the fund investors and managers, fund investors have to face a difficult task: choosing a value for their investments. Adding a fourth valuation will just increase the ‘noise’ for the fund investors, as the third party will only have the same amount of information as the fund investors to produce a valuation by construction. Hence, the intervention of a third party will add to the operational costs of a private markets fund without any substantial benefit for the fund investors. The fact is that this value can only be determined for certain when the fund has been liquidated, that is to say at the end of its lifespan.
* Technically, a third-party valuation is what happens with the prospect of a secondary sale. Potential buyers of a fund stake on the secondary market make a bid which is then 'the market price', the reference of negotiations between the exiting investor and the potential new entrant.
* The _time allocation_ of the fund managers to the various funds under management. It is in the fund investors' interest to assess the time commitment of the management team for existing funds and how it will be allocated going forward.
* _Carried interest_ not being sufficient to motivate a fund manager to deploy its best efforts to manage a fund. A portfolio which is valued below its cost, and for which the efforts deployed by the fund manager could only lead to recovering the fund's initial size and eventually paying the preferred rate but no carried interest, may lead the fund manager to deploy only minimal effort to service this fund. The fund investors' range of action is unfortunately restricted in that respect:
* Either the portfolio is considered a low-expectation investment and _written off_ by the fund investors, who might legitimately walk out of their relationship with the fund manager for further fundraising.
* Or the fund manager can _renegotiate the terms of the fund management_ and set up a new incentive structure on the basis of the current NAV as the cost, and thus calculate the carried interest above this threshold. This comes at a cost for the fund investor, as the fund manager will apply its incentive structure even if the fund is not fully reimbursed. It is thus in the best interest of the fund investors to take pre-emptive action and to make sure that the fund is managed actively and proactively by the fund manager in order to avoid this situation. Experienced fund managers, thanks to long-established know-how and expertise, can avoid this situation and cut their losses or take a turn-around approach early in the investment management to avoid a downward spiral in the valuation of their portfolios.
* _The fund manager mastering the fund information._ The information of fund investors is fully controlled by fund managers, who provide quarterly and annual reports. These documents possibly open the way for action by investors, but the level of details and the time lag in their production dull the potential for action. Fund investors must be diligent in their analysis and may ask for a 'fairness opinion' in order to guarantee that the value of the fund reflects its real value (with all the limits associated with a third-party valuation).

#### Power, Checks and Balances

Fund investors have by definition a confined role in private market funds.29 They delegate management to a fund manager, only controlling and eventually sanctioning the latter. It is thus in their best interest to _define the limited partnership agreement as precisely as possible_ and negotiate clauses that may be necessary for a good relationship over the course of the life of the fund, that is to say 8 to 15 years plus possible extensions.

Footnote 29: Though fund investors are ‘limited partners’, they are ‘not powerless’ (_Private Equity International_, 2012).

Moreover, it is important that fund investors go beyond the written rules of the limited partnership to create an _interpersonal relationship_ with the fund manager. Being part of the Advisory Board is one of the ways to be more involved in the life of a fund,even though the number of seats is limited and often reserved for professionals who could prove useful for the operational life of the fund.

The sanction of a given general partner relies more on the _possibility of the opportunity to invest in the next fund_ than trying to change the course of the current investment made with it. The interaction between fund investors and managers lies in a constructive dialogue, the purpose of which is to assess the evolution of portfolio companies. Fund investors can then compute their own valuations and decide whether or not they want to proceed with the next generation of funds.

Hence, it is in the fund investors' best interests to _closely monitor_ the evolution of the fund and provide the fund manager with _feedback_ and possibly _advice_. There is still a high gap in expectations and resources between fund investors and managers. Most fund managers still consider fund investors as pockets of money, without any additional resources to provide. This can be true, but it is in the fund manager's best interests to assess if they can go beyond and possibly identify potential clients or partners for their portfolio companies in their pool of limited partners. The increased level of professionalism of fund managers and fund investors has led to an _improved quality of dialogue_, which can only benefit both parties. However, the changes in the balance of power - depending on whether the market is more in favour of fund investors (in the case of recession, when investors are wary of putting more capital to work in the industry) or fund managers (in the case of expansion, when money flows are exceeding the absorption capacity of private market funds) - make it _difficult to really establish a consensus on practice_. The legal pressure for more disclosure and possibly regulation, coming from the USA, also has some adverse effects. Some fund managers have increased their transparency, but the industry consensus is that too much publicity can only harm the business. It is thus in the best interests of fund investors to understand what is at stake with every fund manager and establish a specific means of communication.

In the private markets industry, conflict, especially before the court, is highly inadvisable. Not only will this destroy the ability to work on subsequent funds, but it also damages relationships which are meant to last many years. This is also why the replacement of a fund manager is rare and mostly a last resort. In this event, fund investors have to identify a new fund manager and negotiate with it the management of an existing portfolio. This is not only a lengthy and difficult process, but also a costly one, as the new fund manager has to be motivated to turn around a portfolio and generate new and profitable investments.

To make their investment choices, investors must, however, establish some criteria, reflecting their priorities and measuring the performance of their investments with regard to these criteria in order to manage the uncertainty related to private equity investments (see Section 3.3).

### Measuring performance, managing risks and optimising returns

One of the main difficulties in assessing the interest that an investor may have in investing in private equity is to evaluate the performance of private equity funds. Figures are not disclosed publicly and there is no real benchmark to compare the performance of the funds.

This means that performance has to be evaluated in an uncertain context (a), combining lack of information with different measurement rules. However, more than finding the 'right' performance measure for funds, limited partners may be more interested in understanding the nature of the performance generated, aligning their risk-return profile with those of the underlying funds, thus optimising their returns (b).

#### 3.3.1 Measuring Performance in an Uncertain Context

There is no infallible way to evaluate the performance of a private equity team. The performance of a fund is generally evaluated according to two criteria: (i) the multiple of investment (total value to paid-in, or TVPI) and especially the realised multiple of investment (calculated through the distributed to paid-in, or DPI); and (ii) the IRR. A third criterion is gaining ground: the public market equivalent (PME). These measures of performance can be presented net or gross of fees. Only the net measures of performance (i.e., after the payment of all fees and carried interest) are of interest to the investor. However, this can introduce a bias as regards the size of the fund. In fact, the smaller the fund, the higher the impact of fixed costs will be and the net performance will show degradation compared to its peer group.

3.1.1 The TUPI is the Ratio between the Current Value of a Given Asset (a Company or a Portfolio, for Example) and the Price Paid for it

The net multiple of investment (MOIC), also known as TVPI, reveals the global performance of an investment fund. The net multiple of investment is calculated as follows:

* It is necessary to add all the proceeds from portfolio companies, including their sale, transferred to the fund (the 'distributed'). If assets are still in portfolio, then the net asset value (the'residual value') is used.
* Then the costs supported by the fund (including fees) and the carried interest paid to the team are deducted.
* The total of these two operations is then divided by the amount invested in the company.

It is therefore possible to compute a DPI ratio and an RVPI, the sum of which is the TVPI.

_Positive aspects_

The ratio allows investors to know how much they gained for each euro invested. It is cash-on-cash and factual, and difficult to manipulate (except the RVPI). This ratio is important to determine the absolute value creation generated by a given investment. In order to benchmark the performance of an investment with the TVPI, it is important to obtain the net values, after fees and carried interest. This is the only way to have a homogeneous sample and truly assess the performance of an investment.

This measure of performance is easy to calculate at investor level (cash in/cash out), but is far from being perfect.

_Limits_

The TVPI does not take into account the impact of time on the investment, which is why it has to be combined with an IRR analysis. It also does not take into account the context of investments, and has thus to be combined with a PME analysis. It is difficult to compare and analyse quantitatively, and in particular it is not risk-adjusted. Finally, it takes into account the capital effectively invested (not the committed), which has significant consequences for institutional investors (see below).

_As for the valuation of a fund_

The multiple is not reliable if the fund is still active, as it is exact only once the fund has been liquidated and all the fees have been paid, that is to say at the term of the 8 to 15 years of the fund's lifespan. The valuation is difficult when it is necessary to estimate performance during the activity of the fund (before the term), as a part of the portfolio is still not liquidated. The intermediate valuation of the fund is thus determined by the choices of the management team as to the value of the unrealised portfolio. Valuation techniques condition the perception of investors as to the performance of the fund. Some teams may find an incentive to maintain active 'zombie' companies in order to produce attractive (even if unrealised) returns during fundraising (see above).

It is thus necessary to look at other ratios, such as the DPI, which gives an idea of the realisation of the performance, and the RVPI, which is the portion of the performance which has not yet materialised.

_As for the amounts invested_

When an investor commits to pay a certain amount to a fund, he does not pay the total of the commitment upon his signature. Rather, it is the fund manager who calls portions of the commitments as needed by the investments of the fund and the management fees paid to the team. This means that in the majority of cases, an investor will commit to a certain amount, but technically will not pay 100% of it owing to the early distributions of some of the first investments. By reinvesting these early payments, the investor usually pays only 60-80% of his commitment net of the distributions. However, a commitment is translated for an institutional investor by a portfolio of capital which is immobilised in prudential (banks) and solvency (insurance groups) ratios.

To truly account for the total return of a private markets fund investment, it is necessary to add to the multiple of investment the product of the unpaid commitments which are put into liquid placements, and then to deduct the cost of capital as revealed by prudential and solvency ratios.

This question is not truly valid for individual investors and funds of funds. Individuals do not have to observe prudential or solvency ratios as such (they only have to keep some assets liquid in order to meet their liabilities). Funds of funds are in fact buffers between private market funds and institutional investors, thus smoothing the flows and diversifying the risks. In that respect, the absence of prudential treatment of funds of funds opens a debate. Funds of funds have been under-privileged by the Basel II and Basel III Agreements and the solvency regulations, even though one of their main features has been to eliminate the perspective of default from reimbursement in private equity (Weidig & Mathonet, 2004). The multiple of investment is a useful tool for measuring performance, but does not take into account the impact of time on the performance of an investment. Notably, given the fact that the capital calls are made as needed, and as distributions are made according to the sale of portfolio companies, a given multiple can express different investment realities.

A lower multiple, but executed over a short time, can be more interesting than a higher multiple over a long period of time. However, this implies that investment opportunities deliver a constant return over time and that there are no transaction costs or costs of opportunity (which is not true in practice).

In that respect, and all things being equal otherwise, evaluating the performance of small multiples over short periods, or high multiples over long periods, has to be appreciated within the function of the total of the costs involved in each scenario, and also the risk involved. Appreciations can diverge between institutional investors, some being more attentive to the absolute performance (i.e., a high multiple, with a lower sensitivity to the time dimension, such as pension funds) and others to the relative performance (i.e., a lower multiple, but served over shorter periods of time).

3.1.2 The IRR is Calculated through a Formula which Factors in the Impact of Time on a Given Investment

The annualised IRR is calculated by taking into account the quarterly cash flows, and then the eventual residual value of the fund at year end (as audited) is added. It is the rate at which the NPV of cash inflows equals the NPV of cash outflows.

The IRR formula is as follows:

\[\text{Discount rate = flow of year $n$/flow initial year}^{1/n}-1\]

The IRR complements the multiple analysis method, in the sense that it provides for a better comprehension of the nature of the performance of a fund. The impact of the time dimension is obvious on the return, as shown in Table 3.3 and Figure 3.12, but also on the genesis of the performance.

_Positive aspects_

The IRR is useful for comparing the ability of a fund manager to put capital to work and organising the rotation of its assets. However, a high IRR may not be proof of excellent performance. It has to be combined with the TVPI to assess how the fund manager has created the value. In that respect, the _bolding period_ of a given investment is useful information, to truly understand the involvement of the fund manager in a company and whether it has had the time and opportunity to take a constructive approach. Some fund managers may be tempted to sell companies quickly in order to generate a high IRR, even though additional and substantial value could have been created through a longer holding period. Giving priority to the IRR emphasises the quick exit of investments, even at the expense of the better performance of the investment (_Financial Times_, 2005).

Table 3.3: IRR derived from the multiple and the length of investment This is not intrinsically negative, however this kind of operation is difficult to reproduce over time and as a recurring _modus operandi_ (this is a major point of the due diligence of limited partners, as illustrated in Template 3). The IRR is important when the investor wants to evaluate the intrinsic performance of a management team, and especially its aptitude for reproducing performance. Investment pacing and exit timing are crucial, especially when it is a matter of maximising performance. In that respect, IRR is one of the most useful elements of information in understanding performance, but not the only one.

Rapid exits from investments do not open the way for the investment teams to prove their capacity for value creation. Central Europe is an example of this: privatisation and company restructuring have offered numerous opportunities in cable, telephony and other infrastructure industries (energy, water). Some private equity funds have shown impressive IRR, although perhaps temporarily. It is difficult to analyse this performance, as this source of opportunities has mostly dried up. Investment teams have to prove themselves in a different context, and by other means than just structuring attractive investment projects. This is where the evaluation of the performance is key.

Depending on their risk aversion and return expectations, investors may place the emphasis on TVPI or IRR as their main indicator of performance. Funds which are targeting high IRRs may apply a strategy targeting a higher rotation rate of assets, but this means that the fund manager has to identify good-quality opportunities for investment more frequently. This may not be the case, and some investors would rather stay with longer-term investments, but generate higher absolute returns.

Figure 3.12: Investment multiple necessary to get an IRR of 18%, depending on holding period by the fund (expressed in years)

_Limits_

The IRR suffers from multiple limits,30 notably because the formula was developed to compare simple investment projects. It assumes, for example, that any distribution can be reinvested at no cost at the same level of return. This is not the case in private markets. It also suffers from some of the same issues as the TVPI, as it does not take into account the context of the investment (the PME does, see below). It only takes into account the capital effectively invested (not just committed). The IRR is not risk-adjusted and is difficult to compare and analyse quantitatively.

Footnote 30: For a detailed criticism and analysis of the IRR, see Kocis, Bachman, Long and Nickels (2009), Chapters 7, 9 and 11.

The IRR can be manipulated in case of delayed capital calls or quick distributions. This is particularly true when fund managers use lines of credit (also known as 'equity bridge financing'). The principle is that when a fund makes an investment, the fund manager borrows the corresponding capital from a specialised lender. The capital is called from fund investors, usually after a delay. This is when the IRR starts to be computed. By using a credit line, a fund manager in effect boosts the IRR of the investments. In Europe, most of the credit lines are limited by the AIFM Directive to a maximum of 12 months (otherwise, funds can be requalified as 'leveraged funds', as hedge funds are, and are submitted to a higher level of regulatory control). Assuming that an LBO deal is done for an average of 4 years in developed markets, this means that the capital of fund investors is for 25% less time. This could look attractive, except that the capital unused costs money to institutional fund investors, sitting idle on their balance sheet and costing them money under prudential and solvency ratios. There is a significant cost of opportunity, but also a lower absolute return collected ultimately as these credit lines cost interest to funds. Therefore, fund managers can boost their IRR and reduce their performance with these instruments. They can also appear as performing better than their peer group if they are compared exclusively on the basis of the IRR of their funds. Some fund managers go to the extent of using credit lines to anticipate the exit of a portfolio company, to stop the IRR formula sooner and give it a further boost.

Besides a voluntary manipulation, IRRs can be boosted by the simple order of cash flows. If two funds have the same investment multiple of 2.75\(\times\), but one records its best deal first and the less good one after and the other records the deals in the exact reverse order, then the first fund will have a much better IRR than the second. In our example (Table 3.4), the first has a 54% IRR and the second a 29% IRR. The modified IRR (MIRR) can help solve this issue, as it considers each cash flow as starting in year 1 and computes an explicit reinvestment rate. In our example, with a reinvestment rate of 0%, the MIRR for the two funds stands at 16%. However, the MIRR for private market funds would require benchmarks with a common reinvestment rate, which is difficult to gather. They are thus more difficult to compare.

#### 3.3.1.3 The PME Providies Context to Private Market Investments

The PME replicates the cash flow pattern of a private markets fund by buying an index of listed (or unlisted) assets when the fund draws down capital, and selling the index when the fund disposes of assets. The PME can be computed as an IRR or a TVPI.

**Positive aspects**

The PME is the only performance measure which can take into account the context of investment. The performance of the index used as a comparison point provides a perspective on the actual value creation by the fund manager. A perfect PME would in fact match each cash inflow with the corresponding cash outflow to benchmark each investment, but most PME calculations blend the flows to benchmark a fund. Another positive aspect of the PME is that it eliminates the question of the duration of investments, which otherwise prevents a like-for-like comparison between an IRR and the annual performance of an index of listed assets.

_Limits_

However, the PME presents multiple limits. First, it is at times difficult to find an index to benchmark specific private market investment strategies. For example, start-ups in emerging sectors might not have any comparable listed competitors (and thus no index to track them). Benchmarking companies in difficult situations is also difficult, as bankrupted or quasi-bankrupted companies might have been excluded from the stock exchange. As for real assets, the question is even more challenging as listed entities are usually companies operating the assets, not the assets themselves.

The PME also has its own methodological limits. In particular, the formula requires a careful application when a fund is not fully liquidated. Indeed, it is possible to oversell the index: the fund distributing proceeds usually does not communicate how much is a refund of the original investment and how much is the profit (or the loss) distributed. Thus, the observer has to compute a pro-rata of the distribution versus the remaining NAV to regulate the distributions, as explained by Rouvinez (2003).

The PME also does not solve the fact that it is not risk-adjusted, and takes into account the capital invested (not committed).

#### Managing Risks and Optimising Returns

Performance is generally realised over the 5 to 7 years following the launch of a fund, as shown by the curve in Figure 3.13. The profile of a private equity fund is thus very specific: _the J-curve_.

The investment period of a fund is generally 5 years, and the first portfolio companies are sold 3 to 4 years after the launch of the fund. This fund must support the

\end{table}
Table 3.4: IRR derived from the multiple and the length of investmentmanagement fees and initial investments without any revenues. Cash flows are thus at first negative; then, as investments bear fruit, the curve slowly turns around and the fund reaches the break-even point. On the graph, break-even is reached after year 5. At this date, the initial exits (and eventual additional revenues) will theoretically have compensated the investment costs and amount invested. Then, the subsequent exits will compensate further fees and costs associated with the remaining exits and portfolio liquidation.

TVPI and IRR are used mostly to compare the performance of portfolios built by fund managers for funds. In order to compare the performance, funds are sorted by vintage year.31 The vintage of a fund is given by the date at which it holds its initial closing. In order to compare properly the performance of a fund, it is also necessary to obtain its net return figures. It is also necessary to determine which geographical zone the fund covers, what type of financing is provided (VC, LBO, mezzanine, etc.), what the industry is (IT, biotech, consumer goods and services, etc.) and other features. Some databases provide the net performance of comparable funds by strategy, region, vintage year and industry. This can substantially reduce the sample to benchmark the fund, and eventually lead to the conclusion that there is no benchmark for a given fund.

Footnote 31: The vintage year of a closed-end private markets fund refers to the year of its creation. This can be open to debate: it is the date of its first closing (that is, the date at which the fund manager decided to effectively create it legally with a minimum critical mass of capital), the date of its first investment (which is when effectively the fund is active) or the date of its final closing (when the fund will not admit any new investor). Depending on the data source, one of the three possible dates is retained.

_Performance analysis: beyond TVPI and IRR_

It is thus in the best interest of the fund investors to analyse the details of the performance of a fund, investment by investment. The main target of fund investors,

Even though institutional investors consider that experience and track record are the most important elements when selecting a private equity fund, they must be able to evaluate the performance of a team without having the full picture of its investment success.

The challenge for fund managers is to find the right fund size. In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 crisis, it appeared that fundraising became very challenging and some funds were smaller than the previous generation. More recently, fund sizes have been growing very fast, and the frequency of fundraising increased substantially, due to the appetite of fund investors for private market funds and the returns they deliver. Academic studies have since then shown that the optimal size for funds is situated between USD 150 and 300 million for venture capital funds and between USD 300 and 500 million for mid-market LBO funds (see Figure 14).

As market conditions are constantly evolving, fund investors have to evaluate the market where the analysed funds are active, as well as the capacity of the general partner to identify investment opportunities, structure investments, manage them and sell the portfolio companies with a substantial profit. They can be supported in that process by funds of funds managers and gatekeepers.

_Fund investors' due diligence_

Fund investors willing to allocate capital to private equity need to invest a significant amount of resources to assess the teams and have to do so regularly and over a long period of time. It is therefore in the interests of a new entrant to team up with established teams such as funds of funds (for small amounts to be invested) and gatekeepers (for amounts above EUR 25 to 50 million), to help them understand the market dynamics and set up their investment strategy.

Even though this represents a cost, fund investors will benefit greatly from the experience of seasoned professionals, with a good knowledge of the market, teams and past

The generation of performance for each fund has to be reviewed carefully, in order to understand what the knowledge and experience of each member of the general partner is, what the investment pace was, what the successes and losses were, what the analysis of these events is and how they can be reproduced/avoided going forward.

### Pitfalls and Challenges

_Assessing fund managers' investment discipline_

As described above, fund managers have the upper hand in negotiations with fund investors. This is related to their high past performance and the relative persistence of returns of fund managers. The temptation of fund managers is therefore to maximise their income, notably by _increasing their fund sizes_. The logic is that the intensity of the work is the same whether for a small or a large investment, but the income increases a lot in terms of management fees and carried interest if the fund size increases.

However, the downside of this reasoning is significant for fund investors. If the intensity of the work is the same, the expertise changes a lot. There is a direct link between fund size and average investment size. A team usually does 10 to 25 deals with a given fund, depending on the number of team members. If the fund size is USD 100 million and the team plans to make 10 investments, the average investment size should be around USD 8 million (10 times USD 8 million plus the costs and management fees equalling USD 100 million). If the fund size increases to USD 250 million, then the average investment size should be USD 20 million. Larger investments require a different skillset to assess the opportunities, but even more importantly to create value. In the first case, if the team is composed of venture specialists, they are likely to make early-stage investments, that is to say, when start-ups emerge and work through their early recruitments, prototypes and initial launch of a product or a service. In the latter case, they will focus on supporting these companies with commercialisation, industrialisation and structuring, or even internationalisation. This requires a very different network, know-how, expertise and ultimately governance skillset from the investor.

The second consequence of an increase in fund size is that the competition is intensifying for larger deals. The number of opportunities is not significantly affected by the capital on offer (the demand), but by the sources of deals (the supply): macro-economic disruptions, repositioning of conglomerates and delistings are driving the supply of large and mega LBOs, for example. Regardless the capital on offer, these deals are intermediated and will be executed in one way or another. Having more funds competing for these deals ultimately leads to a price increase. The competition also increases because corporations compete to acquire the same companies, but also large fund investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. The playbook of large LBOs has become increasingly well known, and somehow commoditised.

economies of scale and limited exchanges of information with regard to deals which could be done.

This movement has also highlighted a debate before the 2008-2009 crisis: the _convergence between private equity and hedge fund activities_. Even though large LBO funds are more active on the listed stock exchange, overtaking groups and applying their techniques to extract values out of them, the logic of hedge fund investing and private equity investing differs substantially. Some hedge funds have played the free-rider strategy, taking pre-emptively substantial stakes in under-valued, mismanaged companies and hoping for LBO firms to take over these businesses and make the necessary improvements, thus benefitting from their work. Over the course of the last few years, hedge funds have been large investors in private debt and were also co-investors in private equity deals. These were illiquid investments for relatively liquid funds and triggered some difficulties in case of investor redemptions.

Aside from this overlap, hedge fund investing is based on arbitrage and market movements. Some hedge fund managers called 'activist investors' have tried to apply private equity techniques to listed groups, with variable levels of success. The idea is to take a significant minority ownership in a listed group, for example 5%. The next step is to contact the management to undertake some changes in the strategy and management of the company. If the management does not reply to the satisfaction of the activist, then the latter wages a public campaign of communication to gather the support of other investors for his plan. Then, there is a request to change the composition of the company's Board so that the activist can get access to it, ultimately affecting the governance of the group and possibly changing the management. The main difference between activism and LBO investing is that the first uses public scrutiny to push his agenda, while the latter uses the full control of the Board and the confidentiality of private ownership to make changes.

The convergence of hedge funds and private equity funds may be observed on another level, which is the _fund structure_. Private equity fund managers envied hedge fund managers their annual profit sharing, while hedge fund managers envied private equity managers their 10-year lock-up period. Private equity funds are blamed by fund investors for the necessity to commit to a 10-year vehicle with limited exit scenarios. This is a potential issue for investors in need of capital, which is even more extended with funds of funds (often created for 13 to 16 years). Hedge funds resolve this issue thanks to a liquidity clause, after a lock-up period. However, this works to the extent that investor redemptions are limited, far and apart.

A solution to the stickiness of private equity fund stakes was illustrated through the promotion of SPAC vehicles and BDCs in the USA. SPAC vehicles are created as trusts which have to be approved as to their strategy and investment purpose by their trustees. Once the trust is set up, the SPAC becomes a publicly listed vehicle and its shares can be sold by the owners at will (with a liquidity mechanism organised by its promoter).

Jenkinson and Sousa (2009) have raised concerns about the viability of SPACs, noting that more than half of approved deals immediately destroy value (notably because 'the extreme incentives faced by the SPAC founders create corresponding conflicts of interest'). BDCs have seen their values plummet by 20% after the crisis (Kahn, 2011), hence joining the listed private equity sector in its recurring fight against the discount on NAV which affects most listed private equity assets.

The2012b). The practice of club deals has reced nevertheless, notably after the crisis of 2008-2009.

This raises questions about their _proprietary deal flow_. Another difficulty lies in the analysis of their value creation, as private equity firms acting as a consortium will claim that the success of a deal will be closely linked to their action alone. The influence that private equity groups can have on very large companies remains to be assessed during the due diligence, notably by interviews with the management teams of portfolio companies.

_Co-investments_

Instead of structuring club deals, fund managers have been teaming up with their fund investors, offering them to co-invest with the fund. This practice has drawn significant attention. Fund managers like the idea, to avoid the accusation of cartellisation of collusion with their competition. They can still acquire a firm which is bigger than their usual bite size. In the process, they can reward their larger fund investors - or convince new ones to join in the next fund by offering them a flavour of what they do.

Fund investors like the idea of co-investing as they can then reduce the overall fees and costs that they support. Though fund investors still have to invest in the fund (and thus support the costs and fees), they can save some of these costs when investing directly next to the fund. In practice, co-investing is not free (some fees and carried interest might still apply) and might be restricted in volume (e.g., for one dollar invested in the fund, the fund investor can co-invest one dollar). Co-investing can be challenging, as the fund investor gets a rather short window of time to invest, when the fund manager has done all the due diligence and has to decide the amount to invest in the deal. The fund investor then has to decide, and has limited or no chance to do his own analysis. The liabilities attached to a direct investment, as co-investment is, also have to be carefully weighted.

The SEC has also started to investigate the practice of co-investments, as it sanctions fund investors who do not co-invest and rewards unduly those who do. Indeed, when a fund manager analyses an investment opportunity, he ultimately charges the fund for the cost of doing so. These costs are, whether the deal happens or not, paid by the fund. A co-investor would not pay the costs associated with a deal which ultimately did not materialise, and might pay a small share of the costs associated with doing a deal. This imbalance penalises pure fund investors and triggered the investigations of the regulator.

Is co-investing worth the trouble? Aside from the fact that it increases the direct exposure and thus the risk of the fund investors doing it, there is a significant risk of adverse selection: the fund manager does not guarantee a systematic access to all the investment opportunities. A fund investor might not have access to the best one. If he does, he might not have the resources to take a timely and informed decision. Overall, academic and empirical studies have shown that co-investing does not deliver higher returns than fund investing (Fang, Ivashina & Lerner, 2015).

_Increased competition for deals and costs_

Auctioning and increased competition, including from industrial groups, have raised the number of broken deals (hence _break-up fees_), thus accumulating costs for funds without any investment to recoup them. Auctions are pushing private equity groups to be more aggressive and raise their prices. The leverages being applied are increasing, and are sometimes too aggressive to be supported by lenders. This can lead to _failed auctions_, paving the way for a typical private equity negotiation with exclusivity and arm's-length negotiation. It is thus in the limited partners' interest to understand the exact sourcing of investments and how it was negotiated.

_Increased concentration risk for fund investors_

Club deals and co-investments are making it difficult for fund investors to diversify. A fund investor can hope that a fund will deliver a profit by compensating bad investments with good ones. A fund investor selecting multiple funds increases his chances of avoiding or minimising losses. However, funds investing in club deals reduce the diversification effect. A fund investor tempted to co-invest also effectively reduces his chances of diversifying. To address this risk, fund investors have to carefully craft their investment programme (see Section 3.5).

### 3.5 Setting up an investment programme: portfolio construction

#### 3.5.1 The Confluence of Bottom-up and Top-down Perspectives: Portfolio Construction

Investors willing to invest in private markets have to reconcile two approaches: a _top-down_ vision and a _bottom-up_ approach (for further elements, see the introduction to Demaria, 2015). Fund investors make scenarios about the future and look at the past to assess how financial assets behaved under specific conditions. Based on this, they develop an investment strategy which is translated into an allocation to different assets, ranging from listed stocks and bonds to private markets. On this basis they have a top-down vision from private markets, assigning to them an expected level of risk (for further elements, see Demaria, 2019 and Demaria _et al._, forthcoming) and thus a corresponding level of returns, based on their aptitude to stay invested for a specific time (duration). Then, they scout for fund investment opportunities which could match their vision: they scout the market and filter the opportunities. When confronted, the top-down and bottom-up approach led to the construction and management of private market fund investments.

#### 3.5.1.1 Bottom-up Risks

So far, we have covered in this book some of the risks born by fund investors from a bottom-up perspective. Fund investors have to assess fund managers and their fund investment proposals (Template 3 provides a due diligence list). This is the manager selection risk. A good understanding of the private markets universe (see Chapter 4) supports the analysis of fund investors, who have to understand what is available or not. Some of their desired strategies might not exist, such as LBOs in emerging markets due to a lack of affordable leverage in markets with high inflation; or distressed debt investments out of the USA and the UK due to a lack of appropriate bankruptcy legislation. Mapping the market is therefore a significant effort and requires resources and time. Fund investors follow a step-by-step process (Figure 3.17), sourcing the funds, selecting them, negotiating some terms (whenever possible) and monitoring them, to then start the same process again when the fund manager raises the next funds.

#### 3.5.1.2 Top-down Risks

Fund investors have to integrate private equity cycles and macro-economic shifts (see Section 3.1), that is to say, adopt also a _top-down_ perspective. Among the risks that fund investors have to contend with are:- risks of losses due to adverse movements of macro-economic variables such as interest rates in the case of LBOs, or foreign exchange rates in the case of emerging market investments.
* investors in private market funds might not be able to liquidate their positions easily and rebalance portfolios.
* investors might not be able to answer capital calls due to liquidity shortage.
* fund investors might be affected by the inability of their peers investing in the same given fund to answer a capital call (hence potentially missing an investment and reducing the diversification provided by the fund).
* investors take the risk of losing capital with their private market investments. Figure 3.18 provides an illustration with private equity funds of funds.

Moreover, fund investors have limited tools to actively manage their private market portfolios and rebalance their allocations. The only two options are the secondary market for fund stakes, to invest and sell opportunistically, and co-investments to over-weight some private market assets.

#### 3.5.1.3 Programme Costs

Fund investors not only support the fees and costs billed to the funds they invest in by fund managers, but also specific costs. They have to set up and run their private markets investment programme and therefore support operational costs. They also support opportunity costs when private market funds distribute proceeds from their investments. Fund investors usually have to wait until a new fund is formed and calls the capital. Evergreen funds embed these opportunity costs. They support the costs of the

Figure 3.17: The process of fund investing and monitoring

capital committed but not yet called, which is another form of opportunity cost. This capital can be called on short notice (usually 10 to 30 days).

#### 3.5.1.4 Portfolio Construction

The confrontation of the top-down and bottom-up approaches gives birth to an investment programme (Figure 3.19). The output is a grid which will be matched by upcoming funds being raised over the next 5 to 7 years, to diversify not only along the list of criteria in Figure 3.19, but also across vintage years to avoid an ill-timed exposure. As a matter of fact, fund investors should not try to time their investments in private equity markets (Brown _et al._, 2019). The behaviour of private markets and their different sub-segments is particularly difficult to predict, just like the behaviour of financial markets such as the stock exchange. Hence, to properly build a programme, it is necessary to deploy at least over 5 years when setting up a programme, and then regularly invest on a yearly basis to keep the exposure constant.

This means that to appreciate the success or failure of a private equity programme, it is necessary to wait a certain amount of time. Figure 3.20 shows that, for example, programmes still in the J-curve (5 years' duration) exhibit no performance, and that this performance appears as the programme matures.33

Footnote 33: However, a survivorship bias in the data (i.e., only successful limited partners continued beyond a certain duration with their private equity endeavours, which means that the performance of long-term programmes might reflect only the performance of the most successful limited partners) might blur the interpretation of the performance of programmes of 30 years’ duration.

Investing in private equity is hence a long-term project, to invest with fund managers in a succession of at least two to three funds, which should avoid the temptation of

investor can evaluate opportunities and take risks by backing, for example, emerging teams or by investing in funds with original strategies. In fact, the traditional method of evaluation of teams with a track record and a stable market does not apply in the latter case. This could be a marker to determine whether a given investor, fund of funds manager or gatekeeper is just tagging along with other investors or is able to create value. This relates to another specificity of private markets: at the heart of its activity, its logic and functioning, there is the human being (see Section 3.2). Human relationships, the aptitude of investment teams for evaluating managers and to find the right people to develop a business are paramount. These activities are the daily work of investment teams. These very same human relationships will make the difference between good and bad performance.

This performance is the consequence of decisions and of a context set in the past. It will be difficult to reproduce this kind of performance in the future, as the economic environment will have changed with regard to:

* aversion to risk of the stakeholders in the private equity ecosystem
* financing costs
* leverage effect
* stability of the economy.

#### 3.5.1.5 Specific Constraints

This programme is also determined by the specific constraints that any fund investor would have to comply with. Some investors have only operational constraints. Foundations and endowments have to spend a certain amount per year to retain their tax-exempt status. Family offices and HNWIs might require a specific payout for their expenses.

Some fund investors have to comply with regulatory constraints, hence limiting them in their ability to allocate to some strategies for example (for more details, see the introduction to Demaria, 2015). Pension funds might have restrictions on the volume they can allocate to a private markets fund programme. Insurance groups might be restricted in the duration of their investments. Banks might have to handle the solvency costs associated with specific strategies. Regulators assign scores to assets depending on the duration and the capital at risk, and banks and insurance groups have to apply these scores (unless they can show statistically that they diverge from this generic score in their investments).

As a consequence, the performance of fund investors can vary significantly (see Figure 3.21; for further elements, see Hobohm, 2010). This performance depends notably on their appetite for certain categories of funds. Depending on the vintage and the market segment selected, performance can be very volatile. For example, endowments were eager to invest in venture capital funds (whose performance was stellar between 1992 and 2001), whereas banks are traditionally keen on investing in LBO funds. Timing hence has consequences on performance. Supporting emerging general partners and strategies was one of the success factors of endowments and foundations in the USA (see Section 3.3.4). The access of endowments to unique resources - such as a network of alumni - is critical (Lerner, Schoar & Wang, 2005). The tolerance for failure and the relative freedom granted to the investment team in the selection of private equity funds, as well as a certain flexibility in the investment policy, could also be other explanatory factors.

## Chapter The Universe of Investment

Private markets belong to the world of finance, even though they remain far from being only a financial asset class. The analysis of the universe of investments shows the specific nature of private markets: they are the only financial technique able to follow a company or an asset through each of the steps of its existence, from inception to turn-around. Moreover, whether in the investment process, the methods of investment or investment monitoring, what distinguishes private markets is the importance of the qualitative analysis over quantitative data. In that respect, human intervention is really the core component of private markets (see Chapter 5).

Private markets investing finances private (that is, not listed on the stock exchange) companies or assets through the provision of debt and/or capital (Figure 4.1). Private markets investing targets the full range of equity and liabilities of a private company or asset, by providing equity, convertible debt and debt. Equity investments in private companies are classified as 'private equity', debt provision to private companies as 'private debt', and capital and debt provided to finance private assets as 'private real assets' investments.

Figure 4.1 shows a series of instruments to invest in private markets. These instruments can be a source of innovation. For example, convertible debt combines features associated with debt (for risk management) and equity (for performance generation) investment instruments. These instruments can be adjusted to specific investment cases, but rely on the existence of an adequate and enforceable legal environment (see Chapters 1 and 2). Other private market instruments, notably in the real asset sector, are rather recent and some are still in the making.

As we will see, the border between different sectors of investment is porous. For example, in business restructuring, it is often possible to acquire the equity of a company (turn-around capital) for a symbolic amount, or some of its debt to later convert it into capital (distressed debt). Convertible debt itself is at the border between equity and debt investments. Some assets listed at the time of investment will eventually be acquired and delisted ('public to private' LBO). Companies financed by private equity can eventually be listed. In some cases, such as private investments in public equities (PIPE1), a company financed by private equity is and will remain listed. These companies tend to be small or mid-sized and show very low (or even no) volumes of dailyshare trading. In many respects, these 'listed' companies are comparable to their private equivalent.

To mitigate risks, different investment instruments can be used (Figure 4.2). For example, private equity investors can use common and preferred shares, depending on the result of their analysis of a company. Preferred shares can embed different political and economic rights. These rights are negotiated between investors, depending on their perception of the risks and profit potential offered by the investment opportunities. As a result, shares are not necessarily equivalent and fungible: some are potentially worth a lot more than others, depending on the realisation (or not) of certain events, for example.

Therefore, investors have a large choice to fine-tune the design of their instruments according to their needs and the analysis of investment opportunities. This was not always the case. For a long time, instruments were limited to equity and some form of debt instruments.

Figure 4.2 shows that at the higher end of the risk spectrum, debt strategies are non-existent. Debt has to be serviced through the payment of interests (even if they can be deferred), the repayment of the principal (which can be deferred as well) and the establishment of a claim on a solid collateral. This is not applicable to companies at seed stage.

Besides direct active ownership, there are tools to invest with relatively hands-off approaches and without intermediaries - such as equity crowdfunding and crowdfunding. Both focus on the financing of start-ups by any retail or professional investor via a website or an electronic platform. These two investment channels are restricted to

## Chapter 4 Introduction

### 4.1 Introduction

The _Followation_ of the Followation (Followation) is a fundamental problem in which the Followprojects of rather small size, relatively easy to assess and understand by investors, who do not undertake thorough checks and analyses (so-called 'due diligence'). These two investment instruments are recent and largely unproven. In particular, the lack of strong corporate governance rules, associated with light investor protection rules, limited information requirements, limited (or no) monitoring and control cast a large shadow on them. The viability of these instruments will be tested when the financed companies face the strains of an economic recession and have to tackle its challenges.

Our estimate, based on Cambridge Associates and Preqin databases, is that private equity represents 55-60% of the private markets fund investment universe, private debt 18-20% and private real assets 25-28%. The USA accounts for 67%, Europe 20% and the rest of the world 13% of private markets fund investments. Private equity funds represent roughly 5% of the total market capitalisation of listed companies.

### Private equity: Venture, growth, lab and twin-around capital

Private equity funds can finance companies at virtually each and every stage of their development. Private equity fund managers aim to solve specific issues affecting companies, which should significantly increase their value. Investors support entrepreneurs with capital, advice, contacts, know-how and expertise. They act as a sparring partner in the governance of the companies they support. To capture this upside, fund managers acquire part or all of these companies before implementing the plan, and then sell their stake when the company has executed the plan and its value has increased. Two main types of operations are executed by private equity funds: capital increases and transfers of ownership. These two operations can be combined in specific strategies. Database provider Preqin estimated that as of December 2017, private equity funds managed over USD 3 trillion, of which USD 1.1 trillion of committed capital was not yet invested ('dry powder').

#### 4.1.1 Venture Capital: Financing Company Creation

Even though the USA has historically been seen as the birthplace of modern venture capital, and therefore as setting a certain template for would-be investors and fund managers abroad, each country has developed its own version of venture capital. Venture capital funds finance companies from inception (seed capital) to prototyping (early stage), industrialisation (mid-stage) and commercial launch, until they reach profitability or are acquired or listed on the stock exchange (late stage, also known as expansion). Venture capital represents roughly 19% of the private equity funds investment universe, and 11% of the private markets investment universe.

#### 4.1.1 Venture Capital Investment Targets

Venture capital is the main provider of financing for the creation and early development of a specific kind of company. These companies bear strong technological risks, high R&D expenses and often important investments in equipment, intellectual property and more generally fixed assets.

Venture capital is synonymous with healthcare and life sciences (LS) and information technologies (IT) investments (Figure 4.3), essentially in the USA and Westernthe same number of events.

Investment opportunities in emerging markets are only partially covered. In fact, independent funds are still needed in many countries, for example in Eastern and Central Europe. As a consequence, many entrepreneurs emigrate to developed countries to bring their innovation to market, thus impoverishing their home market. Some start-ups catering to specific local needs cannot be delocalised and struggle to emerge. The need to develop clusters of innovation, with a full financing chain, is an important step in establishing a vibrant entrepreneurial scene. Multiple factors have to be combined to establish successful clusters (see previous chapters).

_Elements necessary to a healthy venture capital sector_

As much as any other private equity strategy except large and mega LBOs, venture capital investors are generally active in a specific geographical area, defined by a common business culture and a specific set of rules. What is specific for venture capital investors is that they need one or multiple centres of industrial expertise. It is important that investors communicate and understand management teams on a common cultural basis (_The Economist_, 2009). As a consequence, the type of culture (see Table 4.1) also influences the nature of the investments and the type of companies financed in a given country.

Figure 4.4: Financing of VC-backed companies by number of deals and by region * As of 31 December 2018 _Source:_ KPMG Venture Pulse 2018, based on PitchBook’s data as of 31 December 2018.

Three elements appear as essential to support the innovation capacity of a given country: support for fundamental research; an efficient process to support knowledge and technology transfer; and an environment adapted to company creation in innovative sectors.

Invest Europe (formerly known as EVCA, 2010) has listed factors which, at the macro-economic level, could help to increase the dynamism of venture capital markets:

1. First, fight the fragmentation of European stock exchanges, which is currently partially solved thanks to the mergers at Euronext-NYSE and further movements in Europe (SIX Swiss Stock Exchange-Oslo Stock Exchange). However, the stock exchange landscape remains rather fragmented and hostile for a pan-European listing of promising start-ups.
2. Broaden the tax breaks associated with small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which is a European problem in general.
3. Reduce the barriers to international investment in venture capital.
4. Reduce the administrative, social and tax burden on start-ups (see Figure 4.5), notably by adopting measures adapted to their situation. This type of measure (e.g., thanks to a tax refund on R&D expenses in France2) helps companies to postpone the impact of certain expenses or refund certain R&D expenses. However, not all tax incentives are fruitful or positive. They can introduce distorted incentives, and moral hazard.3 Footnote 2: Credit Impot Recherche.
5. Provide an efficient, clear and integrated system to protect intellectual property.
6. Revise international accounting standards and adapt SMBs. This element is just as important to understand the reading, understanding and communication between investors and leaders.

Table 4.1: Typology of European socio-cultural environments with regard to innovation * Revise the regulation on financial risks. Basel II & III Agreements, the European Solvency II Directive and a few more regulations are hampering allocation of assets to venture capital. These regulations, even if adopted at the supra-national level, can be modified and adjusted by national and pan-European regulations.
* Integrate the commercialisation in the programmes financing SMBs. In fact, most public efforts have been aimed at supporting R&D, but commercialisation is a crucial factor which has to be supported. The competition from incumbents being very strong, SMBs need support to commercialise their attractive products.
* Avoid conceiving public intervention in the form of constraints and restrictions (see Figure 4.5). This is in line with what we have seen in Chapters 1 and 2. It has substantial consequences: 'private equity funds that were active in nations with well-operating legal systems had an average return multiple [...] 19 percent better than the typical fund established in that subclass and that year, while those in other countries had a multiple 49 percent worse than the benchmark' (Lerner, 2009, p. 95).

_Entrepreneurship: resistances and myths_

Resistances to entrepreneurship might also be fuelled by myths surrounding these endeavours. Wadhwa (2011)4 debunks some of them, by recalling the following facts:

Footnote 4: www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/08/02/when_it_comes_to_tech_entrepreneurs_and_their_successes_legends_abound.

* _Technology entrepreneurs are seasoned executives.5_Contrary to the belief that the typical American technology entrepreneur is in his 20s, 'Duke University's 2009 survey of 549 company founders found that the average and median ages of these

founders was 40. Twice as many were older than 50 as were younger than 25, and 43.5 percent had two or more children'.
* _Entrepreneurs are made entrepreneurs, not born as such._ 52% of the entrepreneurs were the first in their families to start a business. Only 39% had an entrepreneurial father and 7% an entrepreneurial mother. Only 25% started in college.
* a nice bedtime story. American-born founders of engineering and technology firms tend to be well educated. 'On average, companies founded by college graduates have twice the sales and workforce of companies founded by people who did not go to college. Surprisingly, attending an elite university doesn't provide a significant advantage in entrepreneurship. What matters is the degree.'
* _Venture capital follows innovation, it does not'make' it._ Less than 5% of venture capital goes to early-stage companies, which take the risk of developing innovative products. 'The reality is that venture capital follows innovation.'

Cultural resistance is illustrated by Bradshaw (2012), describing the American attitude (embracing risks and being eager to grow something large) and the British attitude (cautiously managing cash, mitigating the downside as much as possible and limiting the success target to something achievable). These statements have been made so often, that they are almost ingrained in the collective psyche. As stated by Needleman (2012) and confirmed by the OECD (Figure 4.6), US entrepreneurship has stabilised after a decline in 2008-2011. It increased substantially in the UK after 2009 (Figure 4.6).

_The US venture capital model and its consequences_

Although it is true that the American economy benefits from specific assets, assuming that there is only one way to success ("shooting for the sky") is misleading. Surowieck (2011) explains that part of the American success in breeding successful start-ups comes from'venturesome consumers' (from the retail and the corporate sectors). In business-to-consumer information services, Americans are often ready to embrace technology - and effectively behave as beta-testers of free services - which gives the economy an edge in productivity: 'in that sense, [the American] culture of innovation depends on consumers as much as on entrepreneurs.' Though that might be true for some business-to-consumer innovation, it might not be applicable for business-to-business innovation, notably related to infrastructures and standards. The USA, having dealt with multiple standards in mobile phones, is still today lagging behind Japan and Europe. They ignored text messaging, mobile instant messaging and other consumer innovations for a long time. They are also lagging behind South Korea and Europe for Internet broadband adoption and fibre-to-the-home (FTTH).

There are actually multiple models for entrepreneurial success. The American model focuses on 'lean ventures',6 dedicated to business-to-consumer services, with a limited capital consumption at early stage7 and then with massive needs as the company grows and needs to attract users at scale. The aim is to be listed on the stock exchange or sold for large sums. Shooting at the sky requires large amounts to invest, and thus an IPO or large acquisition for a return on investment. Western European start-ups focus on less visible business-to-business IT, with the target of reaching profitability and then being sold to a trade buyer at a valuation between EUR 50 and 150 million.

_Isnel's model of venture capitalism_

According to KMPG's Venture Pulse, in 2017 more than USD 250 billion was invested in venture capital globally (Figure 4.7). The USA collected USD 130 billion (up from USD 83 billion in 2017), Europe USD 24 billion and Israel USD 4.7 billion.

Bloch, Kolodny and Maor (2012) state that over the course of 2003 to 2011, VC firms have invested USD 11 billion in Israel's high-tech companies, USD 45 billion in Europe, USD 26 billion in China and USD 7 billion in India. According to these authors, 'there is much more to Israel than technological know-how. It is a small, highly networked country with a high concentration of educated workers. Interdisciplinary skills are common, and most workers are multilingual.' This is a clear example of a specific model of a venture capital cluster which has emerged as an original template.

Start-up financing has been closely related to military technology developments in Israel. Gladwell (2011) (quoting Dima Adamsky) illustrates how countries have adopted innovation, with the example of the adoption of the 'Revolution in Military Affairs' (RMA), which'refers to the way armies have transformed themselves with the tools of the digital age'. According to Gladwell, 'Adamsky begins with the simple observation that it is impossible to determine who invented RMA. The first people to imagine how digital technology would transform warfare were a cadre of senior military intellectuals in the Soviet Union, during the nineteen-seventies. The first country to come up with the high-tech systems was the United States. And the first country to use them was Israel, in its 1982 clash with the Syrian Air Force.' This applies to the Internet technologies which were partially invented in the USA (Internet protocol) and Europe (World Wide Web), and later put in practice by start-ups in the USA, Israel and Europe.

Gladwell states that these are 'three revolutions, not one, and Adamsky's point is that each of these strands is necessarily distinct, drawing on separate skills and circumstances. The Soviets had a strong, centralised military bureaucracy, with a long tradition of theoretical analysis. But they didn't do anything with it, because centralised military bureaucracies with strong intellectual traditions aren't very good at connecting word and deed'. This statement applies to a lot of innovations, either coming from public (CERN) or private (Xerox PARC) research centres.

Figure 4.7: Global venture financing by volume and number of deals

Which model of venture capital would be adapted to this type of innovation context (which mostly describes Continental Europe, Russia and Japan)? Darcy, Kreamer-Eis, Debande and Guellec (2009) tried to address this concern by describing the conditions necessary for a technology transfer8 from public institutions to the private sector. They describe notably three options: spin-out (which does not fit with the risk-averse culture in Europe and even more public research labs), collaboration between universities and the private sector (which so far has failed to be widely adopted) and IP licensing (which looks more promising but lacks a platform to match offer and demand).

Footnote 8: From invention and IP generation to business concept, proof-of-concept phase and first customers’ (p. 9).

"The United States', continues Gladwell, 'has a decentralized, bottom-up entrepreneurial culture, which has historically had a strong orientation toward technological solutions. The military's close ties to the country's high-tech community made it unsurprising that the US would come with the technological applications derived from this analysis'.

Finally, Israel's'military culture grew out of a background of resource constraint and constant threat. In response, they became brilliantly improvisational and creative'. However, 'as Adamsky points out, [Israel's] military built around urgent, short-term "fire extinguishing" is not going to be distinguished by reflective theory' (Gladwell, 2011).

This explains notably, in a context of more or less permanent macro-economic crisis in Western Europe and more recently after 2007 in the USA, why Israel's 'innovation model' has been praised; as well as being difficult to generalise and adopt in different economies.

_The European emerging model of venture capitalism_

The model of growth in Europe is one constrained by multiple currencies, languages, laws, business practices and cultures. Staging the growth of start-ups progressively and differently than in the USA, with a continent-wide market, hence makes sense.

Exceptions, such as Skype or Spotify, exist but do not invalidate the conclusion that if a business model is effective, it will be replicated in other countries and multiple companies will co-exist on the European market, hence producing a healthy and durable competition (which might be lacking on the American market, with the consequences attached thereto).9

Footnote 9: Alleged or legally proven anti-competitive behaviours (Microsoft, Google, Amazon), individual privacy mishandling (Facebook, Google), predatory practices (Facebook).

Europe has competitors for Google (in Russia: Yandex), for eBay (in the German-speaking countries: Ricardo), for Yahoo (in Germany: Gmx), for LinkedIn (in Germany: Xing). Discounting these successes would ignore some of the lessons born of these start-ups, which have capitalised on different know-how and might actually outlast some of their American counterparts.

The reassuring conclusion of these initiatives is that ""quality," [psychologist Dean] Simonton writes, is "a probabilistic function of quantity". Simonton's point is that there is nothing neat and efficient about creativity. "The more successes there are," he says, "the more failures there are as well" (Gladwell, 2011).

Hence, there is not yet any European venture capital model, but a series of national initiatives that might lead to a syncretic one: venture capital is structured around clustersin the UK, with leading universities at the core of innovation. In France, certain sectors are privileged, owing to political choices manifest in tax breaks. Swiss venture capital shows specificity: corporate venturing is a major source of start-up financing.

Maybe tapping into the Israeli potential would be a start, as they are lean start-ups adapted to a small market and with international potential. This is the suggestion of Bloch, Kolodny and Maor (2012), notably in semiconductors, telecommunications, medical devices, water treatment and agriculture - all sectors where Europe has assets to develop and capitalise on while collaborating with Israeli start-ups.

The models highlighted by Bloch, Kolodny and Maor (2012) are:

* A typical partnership to share risks and pool resources.
* Investing in local start-ups.
* Setting up a corporate venture capital arm.
* Establishing an incubator in Israel.
* Establishing local R&D centres.
* Acquiring a local start-up.

These six options are actually a way to learn and adapt innovation to local conditions. They might be a template for other models of venture capitalism.

_Other'models' of venture capitalism: the Chilean initiative_

What emerges from different initiatives to build a venture capital industry is that it is expensive and needs long-term commitment, significant funding and cooperation between multiple actors of the innovation and venture capital industry.

The spill-over effect of these efforts (whether successful or not) is actually part of the building of the venture capital ecosystem. These externalities, as economists call them, will coalesce, transform their surroundings and something close to a venture capital cluster will start to materialise. Some countries, such as Chile (_The Economist_, 2012a), have started rather pragmatically by trying to attract the immigrant entrepreneurs turned down by the USA (notably due to a restrictive visa policy).

'Start-Up Chile' hence selects promising start-ups, provides roughly USD 25 000 (pre-seed) and/or USD 80 000 (seed stage) and a visa for 1 year. Between 2010 and 2012, around 500 companies and 900 entrepreneurs from 37 countries have applied. The aim was to have supported 1000 companies by the end of 2013. In 2019, the programme declared to have supported 1616 start-ups (54.5% of which were still active at that time) and more than 4500 entrepreneurs from 85 countries.

The programme has attracted attention, but will it create a self-sustaining venture capital industry and notably push local nationals to start their own ventures? At least the cultural context seems to evolve, as companies apply more to seed financing, universities start to explore innovation centre set-ups, newspapers cover more start-ups and, above all, there is experience and know-how sharing, as well as coaching with local entrepreneurs.

As noted by _The Economist_ (2012a), there is still a need for more venture capitalists, more innovative entrepreneurs and - more worryingly - the idea that this Chilean platform might then lead them to Silicon Valley. Administrative burdens, a rigid bureaucracy and a punitive bankruptcy regime are also slowing down the efforts of Start-Up Chile.

Overall, this initiative might succeed if - like that of Singapore - it lasts (it took 30 years to build Silicon Valley). As long as it lasts, 'when you have a bunch of smart people with a broad enough charter, you will always get something good out of it,' Nathan Myrhvold, formerly a senior executive at Microsoft, argues. 'It's one of the best investments you could possibly make - but only if you choose to value it in terms of successes. [...] Innovation is an unruly thing. There will be some ideas that don't get caught in your cup. But that's not what the game is about. The game is what you catch, not what you spill' (Gladwell, 2011).

_The Economist_ (2012c) states that 'economic theory suggests four main reasons why firms in the same industry end up in the same place. First, some may depend on natural resources [...]. Second, a concentration of firms creates a pool of specialised labour that benefits both workers and employers [...]. Third, subsidiary trades spring up to supply specialised inputs. Fourth, ideas spill over from one firm to the next.'

Wilson (2012) explains that most would-be clusters (Bangalore in India, Shanghai's high-tech centre, Seoul's Digital Media City) never reached their goals:'most efforts to create clusters focus on one or two elements [...] which do not make a difference unless they add up to sustainable serial innovation. To generate one groundbreaking technological development after another, innovation must be embedded within long-lived social institutions and networks. Four different sectors must be linked together: government, business, civil society (non-profit organisations) and academia'. This environment then does not need hazardous coincidences: it nurtures constant sparks of innovation.

For Wilson, three measures are crucial to support the collaboration between these four sectors:

1. Building cross-sector networks that are richer, more diverse and more deliberately structured than in the past.
2. Leaders should continually reform their organisations, to create an innovation climate, adjusting incentives and organisational structures to reward creativity and collaboration.
3. Leaders should invest in talented, innovative individuals, attracting, retaining and empowering the right mix of people who can foster serial innovation.

The last recommendation is actually the crucial point in the case of Start-Up Chile. Is this country, culturally, linguistically and religiously homogeneous, able to retain and 'empower' individuals who came opportunistically? That would mean serious frictions among the local population (as differences are often rejected), and serious efforts to develop a multi-cultural, multi-linguistic and rich environment for an 18-million-strong country, geographically isolated and stretched along the Andes. In its list of potential hubs which could catch up with Silicon Valley and Israel, New York, London and Berlin are mentioned by _The Economist_ (2012c) because they are bigger and livelier, and therefore more attractive to young people; and they have a wider pool of industries and hence skills on which companies can draw.

##### 4.1.1.2 Actors and Structures

_Seed financing or bootstrapping, that is the question_

According to the Monitor Group (2010), 52% of entrepreneurs declare that there is sufficient capital for high-growth companies, but only 37% agree with the statement that there is enough capital to launch companies. A study of Invest Europe (EVCA, 2002) states that 95% of the entrepreneurs surveyed would not have been able to launch their companies without venture capital10 (or that they would have grown much more slowly). 60% state that their companies would not exist without venture capital.

Footnote 10: This is a recurring problem, as Lerner (2009) states: ‘By the time of the Great Depression of the 1930s, there was a widespread perception that the existing ways of financing fast-growing young firms were inadequate. Not only were many promising companies going unfounded, but investors with high net worth frequently did not have the time or skills to work with young firms to address glaring management deficiencies’ (p. 36).

The sources of capital for start-ups are rather limited (see Table 4.2). Most of the funding for entrepreneurs comes from their own savings, their friends and family, and their network. It is only after demonstrating a certain capacity to reach crucial milestones that the circle of potential financial backers will get larger.

Hence, start-ups usually raise capital in stages, as it helps to break down the amounts required into smaller portions and helps entrepreneurs to reduce the dilution of ownership attached to fundraising (see Table 4.3).

_Bootstrapping_

As explained by Karbasfrooshan (2012), _bootstrapping_ (i.e., self-financing by entrepreneurs) is tempting in order to preserve control and ownership. However, giving away portions of the company (or eventually even giving up control)'shines a light on another reality of value creation: you have to ensure that others want to see you succeed and prosper, and the only way to do that is to hand out equity; as John Doerr says "no conflict, no interest". In that respect, a Board of Directors helps when it is time to make tough decisions.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline
**Sources of capital for private companies** & **Start-up stage** & **Growth stage** \\ \hline Founder’s own savings & Yes & Maybe \\ Friends and family & Yes & Yes \\ Angels (wealthy individuals) & Yes & Maybe \\ Professional VC investors & Yes & Yes \\ SBICs (USA only) & Maybe & Yes \\ Corporations & No & Maybe \\ Employee stock ownership plans & No & Maybe \\ Public stock offering & No & Yes \\ Personal and business associations & Maybe & Maybe \\ Commercial banks (debt) & No & Yes \\ Savings \& loans (debt – USA only) & No & Maybe \\ Life insurance companies (debt) & No & Maybe \\ Commercial credit companies (debt) & No & Yes \\ Factors (debt) & No & Yes \\ Leasing companies (debt) & Maybe & Yes \\ Public programmes, R\&D programmes & Maybe & Maybe \\ Tax shelters & Maybe & Maybe \\ Foundations & Maybe & Maybe \\ Supplier financing & Maybe & Maybe \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} _Source:_ Yale School of Management; author.

\end{table}
Table 4.2: Sources of equity capital in the USAHaving small amounts of cash also 'forces entrepreneurs to tackle issues head-on and generate real solutions'. However, there is no room for adjustments in case of obstacles (either difficulties or faster growth than expected). The fact that entrepreneurs are perpetually fundraising (having raised too little or no money to start the company) means that they are being permanently distracted.

Reputation is another problem. Not raising money might actually hurt the business: 'while you may score extra points for building a large business despite being bootstrapped, you don't actually score many points for running a small business if you have avoided venture capital, even though 99.9 percent of VC-funded companies wouldn't exist or last as long as yours if they didn't have VC funding to rely on.'

_Seed financing_

Seed financing is dedicated to help transform an idea into a company. Before becoming very fashionable, seed investing was one of the least favoured areas of investment, because the survival rate of companies is rather low and returns are usually generated over the course of more than 5 years. The fact that Europe offers different opportunities for growth, compared to the USA, has an impact on emerging companies. Innovation tends to be adopted more slowly at the beginning, but accelerates strongly - sometimes outpacing the USA, as was the case with mobile phones or Internet broadband. This explains why seed investments need longer to take off. There is a wide area of political and economic experimentation opened up here.

Some countries have tried to gather certain key elements in 'campuses' (UK), 'technoparks' (Switzerland) and 'poles de competence' (France) to try to replicate the Boston and Silicon Valley clusters. These key elements are usually a source of knowledge (Oxford, Cambridge, ETHZ, EPFL, Stanford, Harvard), solid infrastructures, a qualified and diversified pool of human resources, a qualified and seasoned pool of capital and an entrepreneurial spirit (see Chapters 1 and 2 to further understand the importance of these factors).

According to Lerner (2009), 'on average a dollar of venture capital appears to be three to four times more potent in stimulating patenting than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D' (p. 62). On average, 46 jobs have been created in the companies which have answered the survey, after capital injection.

Table 4.3: Stages of financing for a typical IT firm the _Business angels and crowdfunding_

If venture capital finances innovative start-ups, it is business angels which are considered as the key elements of seed investment. As illustrated in Figure 4.8, they represent roughly 15-35% of the rounds of financing in venture capital, by deal number. Without them, many of the investment opportunities offered to venture capital funds would simply not exist. In volumes, the cumulated amounts invested by business angels are much smaller (Figure 4.9).

Figure 4.8: Breakdown of the number of venture capital deals by stage in 2018

The first step is to use the'safety' to avoid the need for a Second, there is a scenario where the offer of capital exceeds the natural demand. This is the case where investors are over-confident or have no other attractive opportunities to invest. The consequences are stark, as:

* Some non-viable ventures might get financed, thus leading to subsequent losses. This means that investors might leave the venture financing market altogether, or that the amounts lost will have to be reconstituted to be invested in the next generation of start-ups. Indeed, investors tend to reinvest the capital of past successes (and sometimes the capital gains as well) into the new opportunities. Rebuilding investment capacity takes time.
* An excess of capital might finance too many start-ups vying for the same market. This means that the competition is very high from early on. Not only will start-ups not be able to set a higher price for early adopters as they would normally do to build their business viably, but they might also have to launch a price war from the start. As the market eliminates the weaker players, the amounts needed by start-ups to survive in this context increase substantially: they have to last and gain market share when weaker competitors disappear. The return on the total invested decreases correlatively. Moreover, recouping the amounts invested is more challenging, as customers get used to the low prices and might not agree to a price increase later on.
* An excess of capital might also give the wrong incentive to viable ventures. They might collect capital more easily and increase the amounts raised (see Figure 4.11 as a recent illustration). This excess of capital collected will relieve the pressure of making the most efficient use of it, wasting some capital. As capital providers will compete to invest in start-ups, valuations will increase. For a given amount, the productivity of the use of capital will not only be lower, but the investor will get a smaller share of the company. This will contribute to depressing the returns of investors, as valuations at exit (essentially trade sales) might not follow the same path. Figure 4.12 provides a comparison point with Figure 4.11: the number of exits has been fairly stable over time and the amounts (with the exception of Q3 2018) did not change substantially. In Q2 2018, the average exit was for around USD 124 million. It was around USD 146 million in Q2 2019, a 16% increase. As a matter of comparison, the average size of seed and angel rounds increased by 60% year on year (it increased by 42% in 2018).

It is a common mistake to assume that a lack of economic dynamism is due to a lack of innovation, which itself is due to a lack of entrepreneurship, which is due to a lack of capital. Public authorities are regularly convinced to lavish their national start-ups with taxpayers' money. Unfortunately, these efforts are doomed to fail. The market is driven by a number of viable opportunities which are _structural_, and thus require legal, social, cultural and economic changes. Capital will flow to opportunities if the conditions are ripe and if _governance rights_ are properly set, thus leading to profits and a virtuous venture financing circle. Any excess of capital, notably from public sources, will in effect generate significant losses but also depress the returns generated by viable ventures.

The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 4.11.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

A recurring issue for business angels and bootstrapping is their isolation, notably if they venture out of IT. Start-ups are financed in multiple rounds, helping them to reach the next milestone and stage of development. For that, investors have to team up and syndicate their investments as the company grows. They notably syndicate their start-up investments with professional venture capital investors, which are specialised in terms of geographical localisation, industry, but also stage of development. The consequence is that, for example, even if a promising company in renewable energies in a tertiary city in an emerging market gets seed financing from local business angels, it might simply not find any further venture financing. Cleantechs collect very limited amounts globally, and essentially in industrial clusters in developed markets.

Industrial clusters with a critical mass of activity and financing are crucial (see previous chapters). This means that innovation in other sectors than IT is either driven by corporations, or bootstrapping. This does not bode well for the growth of these other sectors, and their innovation, in particular if they are capital intensive.

_Business angels_

Business angels are a catalyst for the emergence of small structures from ideas and business plans. They help entrepreneurs to structure their ideas, develop them professionally, gather initial capital and key human resources, and identify their early business partners. In that sense, they are closest to the original spirit of venture capital, where 'profitability was a goal of the effort [...] but were not the overriding purpose of the [venture capital] firms. Instead, they were depicted as a necessary part of the process' (Lerner, 2009, p. 37).

These business angels are usually former entrepreneurs or exectives who turned out to be HNWIs. As illustrated in Figure 4.13, they are a phenomenon which is

Figure 4.13: Proportion of angel and seed venture capital deals by region: 2009–2012 (as of September 2012)

essentially American. They are necessary to a healthy venture capital sector. Some countries, such as the USA and France, have recognised their importance, by enttling these individuals to specific tax breaks if they invest (or reinvest) in unlisted companies.11

Footnote 11: France has even created specific investment vehicles for these individuals, such as the Sociétéé unipersonnelle d’investigsement à risque (SUIR), which do not seem to have taken off.

According to the Center for Venture Research12 (University of New Hampshire), business angels invest on average USD 22-23 billion per year in the USA. In 2018, USD 23.1 billion was invested by 334 565 business angels in 66 110 companies. These figures are remarkably stable and essentially the same in 2011.

Footnote 12: [http://wsbe.unh.edu/cvr?page=1](http://wsbe.unh.edu/cvr?page=1).

The average deal size is roughly USD 300 000 to 350 000. Indeed, most of the start-ups require small amounts of capital (see Table 4.4).

In 2018, 15% of exits were at a loss (in 2011, 24% of exits were bankruptcies) and more than half were by merger or sale (54% were mergers and acquisitions in 2011). Sectors financed were healthcare (23%), software (20%), retail (13%), biotech (9%), financial and business (8%), industrial and energy (6%), among others. In 2011, sectors of investment were software (23%), healthcare and medical devices (19%), industry and energy (13%), biotech (13%), IT services (7%) and media (5%).

_Equity crowdfunding and ICOs: not such a good idea after all_

At the junction of the retail investment market, the Internet and seed capital is crowdfunding. Internet platforms have emerged to help match start-ups (often in seed stage) willing to raise money and/or sell their first products from/to individuals. The concept has gained traction with the voting in of the Jumpstart our Business Start-Ups Act in the USA in April 2012, which was in effect legalising the concept of mass marketing private placements of the equity of start-ups to the public (donation-based, reward-based and lending-based initiatives are compliant with the regulations). The SEC has issued rules to implement the legal recommendations in 2015,13 and regularly revises and adjusts them.14

Footnote 13: www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html.

Footnote 14: www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/regcrowdfunding.

Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a disintermediated version of an equity crowdfunding offering. An entrepreneur or a company issues a document (a 'white paper') detailing their ambition and for which they raise capital. In exchange for this capital, 'tokens' are

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline
**Amount (USD)** & **Proportion (\%)** \\ \hline Less than 10 000 & 29 \\
10 to 25 000 & 26 \\
26 to 100 000 & 19 \\
101 to 500 000 & 17 \\
500 000 to 1 000 000 & 5 \\ Over 1 000 000 & 4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4.4: Typical amounts of start-up capital requiredcreated and can be further exchanged on a public or private individual ledger maintained by the entrepreneur or the company. These tokens have variable attributes, some of them being a simplified version of a security with no governance rights or representations.

Though highly lauded by the entrepreneurs (who see a cheap and hassle-free source of financing at hand), by individuals (who imagine investing in the next emerging Google or Facebook through these platforms) and politicians (who see a way to bridge the seed financing gap without dealing with difficult questions of taxation and business angel status), this solution might not be as optimal at it seems.

First, because this is 'dumb equity'. Most of the value created by business angel (Kerr, Lerner & Schoar, 2011) and venture capitalists comes from their involvement in the ventures, by providing advice, expertise and networks, but also by controlling the management of a company, sometimes supplementing it or replacing it. Crowdfunding platforms do not provide Board members to start-ups, and in effect leave the crowd of investors without any power to negotiate the terms of investments, monitor efficiently their investment and take action.

Second, because crowdfunding gives the wrong impression that investing is cheap, easy and could lead to great rewards. Playing the lottery is all of these things - but it's not investing, even though the risk is high (see Davidoff, 2012b). In effect, the organisation of annual general assemblies and dealing with the legal correspondence and procedures might consume in postage and organisation a significant portion of the money collected from the crowd investors. Investing requires time-consuming and expensive due diligence, which is necessary to take an informed decision. Business angels themselves have to go through this painful process to negotiate their rights (though not necessarily always reaching the expected result, see _The Founding Member_, 2011).15

Footnote 15: In fact, one of the practices of business angels has been to use convertible debt to invest in start-ups. The reasoning was that this tool, designed for bridge financing (i.e., short-term loans of 12 to 18 months to prepare the next round of financing) would benefit the entrepreneurs (it is cheap to organise and structure and does not involve any discussion on the valuation, which can be postponed to round A) and the investors like it because they have seniority over equity in a debt-free company. However, if the next round does not happen on time (which is quite frequent due to delays in fundraising, or in reaching milestones), the debt matures and companies can be forced into bankruptcy. As there are no assets (hence no collateral), investors lose their money and entrepreneurs are forced to give up. This tool, which looks attractive, can actually have rather dreadful consequences. This is just one illustration of the difficulty in calibrating an investment in a start-up by qualified/accredited investors.

Third, because if regulations have so far protected - and increased this protection of - retail investors, there must have been a reason. This reason is that they lack the expertise of being qualified/accredited/professional investors. By removing the 'barriers' or protections of individuals (after trying to categorise the venture capital industry as a source of systemic risk, see Freeman, 2009), to let them commit in highly 'illiquid' and high-risk ventures might sound quite illogical.

Instead of amending the ill-conceived Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which are burdensome and do not deliver the expected protection, soften the barriers to entry to the stock exchange and hence review the problem of company financing and the participation of retail investors (with an appropriate risk return to their financial profile), the American legislator has put them in the highest-risk investment category and waivedthe patiently elaborated protection designed for stock exchanges - which crowdfunding platforms are16 (focusing on primary placements). Some of the largest frauds of the 2007-2009 period were Ponzi schemes (which were tested on a large scale in the 1920s), to which professional investors succumbed. How could retail investors see clearly through opaque emerging start-ups without thorough due diligence, and protect themselves from the risks they would have identified through due diligence without any negotiating power (Schonfeld, 2012)? The Jellyfish tank case (Jeffries, 2012) is just one example of why crowdfunding is deemed to be a future source of problems.

Footnote 16: As confirmed by the fine that the SEC imposed on SharesPost for trading shares of private companies (see Linley, 2012; Rappaport & Eaglesham, 2011).

One might argue, though, that crowdfunding has always existed in one way or another, notably when people started cooperative companies; or when people financed the emerging company of one of their neighbours or family members (the 'fools, friends and family' category). First, cooperative companies empower everyone to be not only a business owner on an equal footing with anyone else, but also systematically part of the business decisions. To put it differently, there is no founder and no management shares; no specific rights, notably because cooperatives do not have shares. Everyone is strictly equal and the management of the cooperative is not aiming at liquidity or profit.

Then again, people financing a start-up from a neighbour are actually not the crowd, but people who actually know this person (more or less) on a personal basis. Due diligence is replaced by an intimate knowledge of the individual, his/her background, family, behaviours... The background check does not have to be done, because it is immediate and capitalised over the year informally. There is no such thing in case of crowdfunding, where total strangers are dealing with one another.

Some crowdfunding platforms argue that they select projects before admitting them for fundraising. Regardless of the fact that their interests lie with the fundraiser (who will pay them a commission in case of success), the due diligence of the crowdfunding platform will never replace the expertise of a business angel or a venture capitalist.

At the end of the day, the risk of crowdfunding is that it will be receiving projects which have been rejected by other sources of'smart capital' (adverse selection), notably because entrepreneurs are aware of what professional investors bring to the table (and are ready to give up ownership and control and to cope with diplomacy in exchange for that); or are judged too expensive by professional investors (me-too business-to-consumer start-ups tend to exhibit this feature).

Indeed, most of the profits over the last venture capital cycle have been made in the business-to-business sector, with companies addressing technical issues in semiconductor design, in storage (virtualisation, big data management, cloud computing), in software design and automation, and other specific areas that retail investors fail to grasp properly. Biotechnologies, clean technologies, new materials, medical technologies and a large portion of the economy will in effect remain out of reach of this financing technique. However, the legal precedent of loosening the protection of retail investors will have long-lasting and resounding consequences, which might be on the scale of the abrogation of the Glass-Steagall Act in the 1990s and the consequences attached to it in terms of systemic risk.

_Private placement platforms: also not such a good idea_

Another initiative might have resounding consequences: the advent of private placement platforms17 such as Nyppex, SecondMarket and SharesPost (see Gelles, 2010). Although their fortunes have dwindled with the official listing of Facebook and Zynga (which made the bulk of the transactions on these platforms - Facebook accounted for two-thirds of transactions on SecondMarket, according to Dembosky, 2012),18 and hence might reduce the risk of major problems, the concept itself cast a shadow over the idea of venture capital secondaries.

Footnote 17: The equivalent of private placement platforms for ICOs is each of the individual public ledgers dedicated to each ICO through which they are exchanged.

Footnote 18: In effect, Goldman Sachs has closed its ‘GSTrUE’ (Goldman Sachs Tradable Unregistered Equity OTC Market) which was specialised in trading 144a securities. Launched in 2007, notably to trade soon-to-be-listed shares of general partners such as Oaktree and Apollo, it was closed in 2012 (see Lattman, 2012). That did not prevent dark pools from launching their own initiatives (Demos, 2011).

By in effect trying to replicate the stock exchange to allow shares to be traded between qualified/accredited/professional investors, these platforms have actually accredited the idea that selling a stake in a private company is necessarily a matter of a liquidity event. It should not be.

Actually, solving the problem of venture investing is dealing with a growing gap between the time horizon to develop a start-up successfully and bring it to maturity (on average 9.4 years in 2010, according to Knowledge@Wharton, 2010)19 and the time horizon of a venture capitalist (between 3 and 7 years). By staging investments, venture capitalists have paved the way for specialisation of their activity according to the maturity of a company. The next steps would be to offer them an exit as soon as they have done their work, that is to say, bringing a given company successfully to the next milestone (or development stage).

Footnote 19: Anecdotal evidence suggests that this time did change significantly since then: [https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/startup-exit/](https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/startup-exit/).

Historically, the rule was that venture investors should all stay invested together until a liquidity event happened. That would align the interests of historical shareholders (who have an intimate knowledge of the company) and the newcomers (who have a very limited knowledge of it). This was also related to the fact that financial resources were scarce, as the venture capital industry was still very small.

This is no longer the case: venture capital funds can reach the size of a billion, and the due diligence capacities have increased thanks to the expertise of the teams, the documentation routinely produced by start-ups (thanks to affordable software) and the due diligence specialists available on the market. Hence, secondaries are not only possible, but they should be encouraged, though not through platforms (see Patricof, 2009 for an examination of the consequences of the emergence of the Nasdaq on the IPO market and the race towards size and subsequent dearth of IPOs in recent years).

Arm's-length transactions, between professionals who know each other, have built a sound reputation and can demonstrate achievements as owners of a given business are actually what define a healthy secondary transaction. Eliminating the'middle man' or the process of due diligence does not make sense: if auctions in LBOs are highly documented and require extensive due diligence in mature, stable and documentedb businesses, it does not seem logical to imagine that start-ups can waive the costly, tortuous and painful but necessary acquirer due diligence.

##### 4.1.1.3 Venture Capital Funds

Venture capital funds represent the large majority of formal start-up financing (Figure 4.14). The USA has shaped the modern limited partnership structure in many respects. It also realised early on that in order to set up a dynamic venture capital industry, it had to involve public money either through direct contribution to the funds (through its SBIC programme), or by granting their portfolio companies a certain access to public investments (through the Small Business Administration Act).

_European approach: the attraction of retail venture capital_

Similarly, European countries have either tried to promote investment vehicles by giving them special tax treatment,20 or by encouraging them through public seed programmes.21 According to Invest Europe (EVCA, 2009), nations rank differently as to venture capital investments than for the overall private equity sector. The UK and France are leading the European rankings. This leading position of the UK and France as to European investments tends to show that this sector needs to be nurtured by adapted regulations, taxation and more generally by a favourable 'ecosystem'. Venture capital

Footnote 21: The Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium have set up an equivalent of the American SBIC programme at different stages.

Figure 4.14: Sources of start-up financing

investors are generally specialised not only by sector, but also according to the maturity of the companies they are backing. Switzerland comes fourth as to corporate venturing and sixth as to venture capital investments.

VC gathers _captive investment structures_, which belong to banks or insurers, and _independent teams_. These captive structures are mostly European and continental.22 This is related to the fact that retail investors can invest in VC retail funds with tax rebates. Distributing these products means having access to a wide network, such as banks or postal ones, for example.

Footnote 22: Though Asia might have developed its own version, financed by conglomerates, listed groups and sovereign wealth funds.

_On and off... and on: corporate venturing_

_Corporate venturing23_ is another form of captive team,24 where companies provide capital to invest in emerging companies. The interest of large corporations in venture capital is driven by industrial synergies (29% of investors) and financial gains (50% of investors). For 21% of investors, synergies and financial gains are of equal importance. For entrepreneurs, corporations can bring expertise, knowledge, know-how, contacts, services and knowledge of the industry which might be beneficial.

Footnote 23: For more information, see www.globalcorporateventuring.com.

Corporate venturing capital (CVC) efforts have mainly been a succession of'stop and go', owing to the fact that corporations tend to sacrifice these units during cost-cutting programmes and launch them when they feel rich - which usually means at the highest point of a business cycle. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 350 corporate venturing programmes were launched (40% of which have been active for 3 years or more). According to Bielesch _et al._ (2012), there are more than 750 programmes active worldwide. 1466 programmes were counted by the Global Corporate Venturing website in 2018. The number of new CVC firms investing for the first time increased from 64 in 2013 to 264 in 2018 (CB Insights, 2019). CVC programmes have ramped up their global activity from USD 10.6 billion invested in 1029 deals in 2013 to USD 53 billion in 2740 deals in 2018 (CB Insights, 2019).

In 2013, North America dominated CVC programmes, with 64% of the deal share by continent. Asia represented 19%, and Europe 16%. In 2018, the figures were 41%, 38% and 17%, respectively. This allowed some emerging markets such as China to catch up with developed markets, with 29 deals representing USD 0.3 billion in 2013 and 351 deals representing USD 10.8 billion in 2018. As a matter of comparison, Japan started with 70 deals and USD 0.1 billion in 2013 and reached 317 deals representing USD 1.4 billion, while the figures for India were, respectively, 18 deals for USD 0.1 billion and 71 deals for USD 1.8 billion. These figures have to be put in perspective, however: only the disclosed numbers are accounted for by CB Insights. The reality might differ substantially from reported figures.

The interest of corporations does not stop at arm's-length initiatives. Some corporations invest directly off their balance sheet. In fact, the number of deals done directly

The_The classical model reborn: independent teams_

_Independent teams_ have thus been thriving, sometimes starting as captive teams and slowly acquiring independence as their track record was being built. Teams generally have a sector focus (IT, LS, clean techs, new materials) and very often even specialise in various sub-segments (telecommunications, semiconductors, software, mobile technologies, infrastructures for IT, for example). Geographically, teams focus on a region. If a firm covers multiple regions, they open local offices and share knowledge and expertise. This is the case for Sequoia Capital, which has opened offices in Israel and China.

#### 4.1.1.4 Operational Activities

Venture capital appears as one of the most emblematic forms of private equity investments (see Figure 4.15). Because of its simplicity, it is historically one of the first to have appeared. VC investors acquire a stake in a company in the form of equity. They often pool their efforts and build an _investment syndicate_, which usually reinvests as long as the company develops and shows some promising outcome. Venture capital investors usually have different expertise and know-how. As they syndicate and attract outsiders, they can offer a richer network and pool of competences.

The dynamics of syndication vary depending on the sector considered. We can differentiate industries with:

* A high level of diversification and a moderate level of syndication, such as IT industries.
* A moderate level of diversification and a moderate level of syndication, such as non-IT industries, medical and life sciences, as well as semiconductors.
* A low level of diversification and a moderate level of syndication, such as communications and media, as well as biotechnologies.

## Chapter 4 Introduction to Future equity, DeBT and Real assets

The study of the impact of the equity and the equity of the equityThe dispersion of returns in venture capital (see Figure 17) might be difficult to understand. It is in the nature of VC investing to see a significant proportion (if not the majority25) of the portfolio companies fail. The reasons for these failures are quite numerous:26 beyond betting on the wrong innovation (LCD vs MEMS in routers), sector27 or standard (AAC vs MP3 in music), the market might be too small (satellite telephones), not solvent (cures for rare diseases in poor countries), or support only one or very few contenders (satellite radio, social networks).

Footnote 25: 75% according to Shikhar Gosh, quoted by Gage (2012).

Footnote 26: They are summed up by Tyejee and Bruno in Lerner (2009, pp. 51–52).

Footnote 27: 7’Venture capital investors’ mission is to capitalize on revolutionary changes in an industry, and the well-developed sectors often have a relatively low propensity for radical innovation’ (Lerner, 2009, p. 60). However, it is difficult to identify which ‘new sectors’ to invest in (healthy pet food, personal medical diagnostics) and which ‘traditional sectors’ will still benefit from innovation (e.g., health records and health management).

It might also be that the technology aged faster than expected due to another innovation, or that the innovation was introduced too early for the market to pick up, or was copied by a bigger company with more marketing power. Beyond that, the operations might have failed to produce a reliable product or service (despite promising pilots or beta tests), the management team might have split because of strategic disagreements, some may have died prematurely. The reasons which lead portfolio companies to a dead end form a never-ending list.

_Venture capital and valuations_

Even if the company succeeds in building a viable product/service, with a sufficiently large market, with an effective position on it, addressing solvent customers and growing, it does not necessarily translate into a profit for venture capitalists. Not only do the valuations at entry and exit matter a lot to generate profits (some successful companies started in 1997-2000 and were financed at very high valuations, and were later sold at a loss despite being profitable and growing rapidly), but also the exit path matters (IPOs are more lucrative and some investments were made with this exit in mind - to finally end up being acquired by a corporation for a much lower price).

Even though in expansion, venture capital has witnessed business cycles, one of the most emblematic being the 1998-2003 cycle. The crash of 2000 can be analysed as an excess of available capital compared to the absorption capacity of the market:

Figure 17: Dispersion of returns in venture capital

there were not enough innovating projects which corresponded to the VC investment philosophy. This led to some form of introspective analysis, on whether the VC model is 'broken' (Mulcahy, Weeks & Bradley, 2012)28 or not (Demaria, 2012;29 Primack, 2012a). Smaller funds were raised as the industry suffers from a certain lack of attractiveness, notably due to disappointing performance while the excesses of 1998-2003 were being mapped up. Since then, venture capital has recovered, and large funds have been raised and deployed again.

Footnote 28: www.kauffman.org/uploadedfiles/vc-enemy-is-us-report.pdf.

Footnote 29: www.pehub.com/176010/is-enemy-fact-us/.

Another VC boom was fuelled by the 'Internet social media' start-ups (_Financial Times_, 2011b). Facebook, Groupon, Twitter and the like raised USD 5 billion in the first semester of 2011 (Reuters, 2011), the largest amount invested since the USD 55 billion deployed in 2000. A potential bubble was created (_The Economist_, 2010), with 'concept' companies being chased by potential investors, and strong herd investment behaviour and very high valuations for companies which were still private and with no revenues.30 The lack of revenues has encouraged high valuations (Bilton, 2012): ""It serves the interest of the investors who can come up with whatever valuation they want when there are no revenues", explained Paul Kedrosky [...]. "Once there is no revenue, there is no science, and it all just becomes finger in the wind valuations."

Footnote 30: YouTube, FriendFeed, Zite, Hot Potato, Beluga, GroupMe, TweetDeck, Dodgeball, Instagram.

The crash happened in 2012 after Zynga, Facebook and Groupon went public, and the aftermath was limited to the Internet social media this time. One of the differences of this 2007-2012 boom and crash is that it was truly international, with very high valuations for Russian, Chinese, Indian and European concept companies. As Reuters (2011) states: 'In [...] 1999 through 2001, the VC industry sank USD 96.4 billion into web start-ups alone, with more than 80 percent of that [...] in the United States [...]. Of 10 755 VC deals over that run, 7174 took place in the US market. Not so today. Of the more than USD 5 billion of VC money invested so far in 2011, just USD 1.4 billion has been deployed in US start-ups [...]. Roughly three quarters of the 403 deals have taken place overseas.'

Just like the previous one, that crash did not affect each company the same way. Some were winners, others did not fare so well. Facebook was valued above USD 100 billion while being private vs USD 60 billion at the end of 2012; Groupon above USD 15 billion vs USD 4 billion at the end of 2012 (_The Economist_, 2011). The first went public, with initial difficulties, and then started its ascendancy to multiply its price per share by six over the course of 7 years; the second is trading at 10% of its peak price per share at the time of writing.

Europe is still spared from this kind of difficulty as the market does not seem to have reached maturity yet - but exhibits problems of its own as a lot of its VC funds do not seem to reach the critical mass required to have attractive returns and hence be really viable (see notably Kelly, 2011, who confirms that Europe lacks this critical mass and a mature venture capital ecosystem).

_Venture capital exits: IPO or not?_

Beyond this list of failed companies or loss-making investments, some of the portfolio companies will pay off handsomely and compensate for the losses of the rest of the portfolio. This happens with successes such as Google, Yahoo, Cisco and other listed companies. They are the most famous investments from venture capitalists, but they are also exceptions (see Figure 4.18).

However, IPOs are very lucrative exit paths. Indeed, when the 'IPO window' is closed (as happened in 2009, see Figure 4.19), venture capitalists, even if breeding successful companies, can generate sometimes rather mediocre returns due to the fact that none of the'stars' of their portfolio could gather the returns able to lift the portfolio performance up to the usual standards of return for the risks supported by investors (Waters, 2010).

VC investors hence rely on access to stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq for their biggest successes. In Europe, there is no real equivalent, even though the AIM and Alternext are trying to rise to this status. In fact, European venture capitalists rely on large groups to acquire their portfolio companies. Kelkoo, which was financed by SGAM, Banexi and Innovacom, was acquired by Yahoo. Skype was acquired by eBay, and later Microsoft. Some - such as Iliad or Tableau Software - went public successfully, but still appear as exceptions. This is related to the fact that the time horizon of a fund is rather constrained and that portfolio companies may not grow fast enough to reach the stage where they could safely become listed.

Depending on the evolution of the stock exchange mergers, the London AIM could become the stock exchange of reference for European, and even American, companies (Braithwaite & Demos, 2011). British regulation is lighter than American regulation,31

Figure 4.18: Exit paths for VC investors, broken down by type of exit

although there are multiple options to go public in the USA.32 American regulation, and notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has in fact considerably increased the duties of listed companies in the USA, hitting large groups and small and medium-sized capitalisations indiscriminately.

Footnote 32: Going public is mostly for big companies with a market value of above USD 100 million. SEC Regulation S-B offers a simplified procedure for companies with a value of USD 20–50 million to sell stock to the public. Sometimes large private offering procedures are close to public ones: Small Company Offering Registration (SCOR) to offer to the public USD 1 million or less with very light procedures; SEC Regulation A to sell up to USD 5 million to the public at low requirements (costs are usually USD 75 000–125 000). SEC Regulation D, which is an alternative to a venture capital round, with offerings to the public.

As languages and business cultures are close to each other, the AIM is an attractive alternative.

This stock exchange needs the critical mass of listings that could promote it to the status of a genuine European listing platform for European growth companies (which is lacking, as can be seen from Figure 4.20). The competition from other stock exchanges (notably Asian, and among them Hong Kong) hampers these efforts.

Figure 4.21 shows that overall there is a low rate of entrepreneurial activity in high-income economies, as individuals have the choice of accepting jobs and have to face high competition if they start a business. However, Canada and the USA still record levels above 15%. Israel positions itself around 12%, a level that only the Slovak Republic and The Netherlands approach.

Europe still has significant progress to make.

##### 4.1.1.6 Limits

Not every young company needs seed or venture capital. In that respect, Microsoft was only marginally venture backed. Its development was essentially financed through its commercial agreement with its first client (IBM). The same statement applies to Google: even though financed by VC funds, it raised only two rounds of financing. In contrast, Federal Express had to raise multiple rounds of financing to support its development in the 1970s, at a time when venture capital was very scarce. The capital intensity of its business explains this need.

There is therefore no real strict rule as to VC investments, just as there is no clear border between venture capital and growth capital.

#### Growth Capital: Financing Companies' Expansion

Though probably the most ancient form of private equity investments, growth capital is not easy to identify. Often it gets confused with venture capital (notably late-stage VC, which can finance cash-flow-positive companies, or even profitable companies). It can also overlap with small and mid-sized LBOs, notably when the LBO goes along with a capital injection. According to Cambridge Associates and Preqin, GC represents roughly 12% of the PE fund investment universe (6% of the PM universe), although this amount appears rather low.

##### 4.1.2.1 Growth Capital Investment Targets

Nevertheless, growth capital is generally associated with the financing of strong-growth companies (see Figure 4.23), which are usually profitable. These companies need capital to finance their development, increase their production capacity, support a sales effort or develop internationally. Growth capital is therefore focused on growth financing, helping companies which are not able to get loans either because of their size, their financial record or because banks are still deeming them too risky.

##### 4.1.2.2 Actors and Structures

Interestingly, most of the LBO fund managers declare that they are growth capital investors as well, thus blurring the border between the top end of growth capital and the low end of LBO. It is therefore difficult to identify the specialists in this area, even though it appears to be the leading sector in certain countries such as Spain and Switzerland. Growth capital also acted as replacement capital (i.e., buying out the owners of a business) for a long time, before the LBO became well known and investors and banks were sophisticated enough to import it (through owner buy-outs, or OBOs).

LBOs do not provide any capital to a company, as it is just a way to manage a transition of ownership. So, if an LBO fund manager is willing to inject capital into a company, that operation will be growth capital. This also applies to PIPEs, which can either be the acquisition of blocks of shares (secondary purchases on the stock exchange) and/or growth capital operations made through the acquisition of new shares (primary purchase on the stock exchange).

Pure growth capital funds may have different targets. Some emanate from industrial groups, with a strong mid-market focus and an industrial perspective. 21 Investimenti, in Italy, is an emanation of the Benetton family and has even set up a sister company in France (21 Central Partners). Others are part of the offering of a private equity team, such as Adrian (ex-Axa Private Equity), which has developed multiple lines of products.

There are also many captive teams. Banks find a logical development in private equity through growth capital. Given the credit history that they are registering continuously with their corporate clients, they are able to better evaluate the risks associated with capital injection - thus offering an alternative to simply refusing a loan. Banks have a natural deal flow coming from their commercial activities. These are usually small proximity funds for regional (Zurcher KantonalBank in Switzerland, Institut de Participations de l'Ouest33 in France) or national banks (BNP Paribas Developpement in France).

Footnote 33: Now part of Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC).

#### 4.1.2.3 Operational Activities

Growth capital funds take minority and sometimes majority stakes in companies, mostly through capital increase. These companies are not indebted (or at very modest levels), as they need all of their resources available in order to finance their

Figure 4.23: Lifecycle of a company and growth capital

development. They are usually not a competitive target for an LBO, as they cannot service the acquisition debt and can be subject to unstable revenues depending on their ability to capture market shares or to enter a new market. This relative lack of attractiveness explains the comparatively small size of assets under management (Figure 4.24) and has probably spared growth capital the consequences of the VC bubble which burst in 2000-2001; and of the LBO bubble in 2008-2009.

#### 4.1.2.4 Challenges

Growth capital is another historical version of private equity, as it is a somewhat simple investment method. One of the features of growth capital is that it does not need a complex financial ecosystem to exist, unlike VC or LBO financing - which both imply the existence of specialised financial actors. The importance of growth capital, on a given private equity market, can be one of the indicators of the maturity of this market. The higher the share of private equity operations it represents, the less mature is the market in many respects.

In fact, the main competitors of growth capital are banks, able to take more risks in their lending policies; stock exchanges, able to welcome smaller companies and to finance their development policies; and corporations, willing to take over promising relays of growth.

However, growth capital could be subject to a renewed surge, owing to multiple factors. The Basel II and III Agreements will lead to restrictions on bank loans for risky (i.e., mostly small and medium-sized) companies. Stock exchanges should normally offer alternatives, but suffer from the fact that the cost to list is increasing, owing to stricter regulation, and the fact that a company needs to be recommended by analysts when they have to raise capital or debt. Investment banks have been reducing their financial research departments, as they are less and less able to recoup research costs through

Figure 4.24: Private markets assets under management as of 2018

the "listing twilight zone": they are unable to raise capital or debt through the markets, and they cannot delist alone because it is too costly. These companies offer opportunities for growth capital funds (through PIPEs or delisting) willing to take them over and support their development.

##### 4.1.2.5 Limits

Growth capital investments are probably the least risky in the private equity sector, as the companies are mostly profitable (or are soon to be) and growing. The return is theoretically also less attractive, as these companies are already valued with the inclusion of their growth perspective. They are still an attractive investment as they offer relative security to the investor compared to LBOs and venture capital, and the return is still higher than on the stock exchange.

##### 4.1.3 LBOs: Financing Companies' Transfer of Ownership

LBOs are the result of financial innovation: the use of financial, legal and tax levers to buy a company (or multiple companies in the case of leveraged build-up, or LBU - see below). The purpose of an LBO is to manage and finance the transfer of ownership of a company by using a combination of capital and debt. The sale process can be at arm's length or competitive (through an auction), as illustrated in Chapter 5.

The buyer of the company34 will borrow against future cash flows generated by that company (which is also the collateral of the debt). For that purpose, the targeted company has to generate substantial and stable cash flows. The amount borrowed by the buyer can reach up to 60-80% of the price of the company, depending on the characteristics of that company. The rest is provided by the buyer under the form of equity.

Footnote 34: To structure the LBO, the buyer will set up one (or multiple holding) company(ies). The buyer will inject capital under the form of equity in a holding company. This holding company will borrow from banks or specialised credit institutions (such as mezzanine funds, see below). The total collected will allow the holding to acquire the target company from the seller.

Figure 4.25 illustrates the central role played by the holding company and the cash flows. The bank lends the money to the holding company, whose only asset (and reason to be) is the ownership of the target. This implies a structured finance operation, which is very specific as it is not a traditional loan. In the example of Figure 4.25, a mezzanine fund is part of the structuring. This fund is between the bank and the LBO fund, whether we look at the seniority of the debt or the share of the profits received. A mezzanine fund invests via convertible debt. It first gets interest, and if the structuring is successful, it will also get a share of the profit generated upon sale of the company. In Figure 4.25, the operation is a management buy-out as the management of the target company invests in the holding along with the LBO fund.

Thanks to this mechanism, the company bought out will pay dividends to the owner (the holding), which in turn will repay the debt and the interest. The collateral (guarantee) of the debt of the holding company is the shares of the companies bought by the holding. If the structuring fails and the holding cannot repay the debt, the bank will become the owner of the company. The company bought out pays for its own acquisition. Depending on the success of the operation and the impact of the final ownership by an LBO fund, the value of the company will grow and it will finally be sold to repay the debt, the capital and to generate a profit.

LBOs are essentially operated in developed markets (see Chapters 1 and 2), as this type of operation requires rather low interest rates and thus low inflation rates. It also requires an adapted tax and legal framework, as well as an efficient enforcement of legislation and court decisions. Moreover, it requires specialised actors and a certain level of sophistication from investors and lenders. According to Cambridge Associates and Preqin, LBOs represent roughly 69% of the PE fund investment universe (38% of the PM universe).

##### 4.1.3.1 LB0 Investment Targets

_LBO targets and purpose_

LBO fund managers target profitable companies which have:

1. Either a specific ownership problem to solve - succession/inheritance, retirement, divorce of owners, exiting co-owner; and/or
2. A specific project to put in place - structuring35 (process overhaul), modernisation, acquisitions/consolidation (horizontal by buying competitors; vertical by colonising the value chain), restructuring/divestments, internationalisation, outsourcing/insourcing (production, sales, R&D), see Figures 4.26 and 4.27.

Footnote 35: Kocis, Bachman, Long and Nickels (2009) state ‘the central goal of buyout is to discover means to build [...] value. In many cases, this work has included refocusing the mission of the company, selling off noncore assets, freshening product lines, streamlining processes, and often, replacing existing management. A happy conclusion to this disruptive process is that the company reinvigorated, brought public [...] or sold at a profit to a strategic buyer’ (p. 9).

Figure 4.25: Example of management buy-out structuring

LBO investments are usually done through majority ownership (notably to benefit from the tax leverage, see Section 4.1.3.3). Minority ownership in a buy-out is possible, however; notably in the case of replacement capital (e.g., to facilitate the exit of a current owner - a case of owner buy-out - see below), or on emerging markets where the leverage is not accessible and legislation prevents the control of local companies by foreign owners.

Most LBOs are based on the assumption of buying a company at a certain price, executing a given strategy in 2 to 5 years, and reselling the company at a higher price at the end of the holding period (either to another company/group, or to another financial investor).

_Types of LBOs_

There is a wide range of ways to structure an LBO, with different levels of risk attached to each of them. The level of risk increases with the number of moving parts.

* as the buyers use debt for the acquisition. OBOs can fail when the debt increase is not matched by an operational plan to significantly improve the performance of the company. A value creation has to match the added risk. If a fund is involved, this is a'sponsored' OBO, if not, then the OBO is 'unsponsored'.
* An alternative is _management buy-out_, a leveraged buy-out which is led and substantially backed financially by the current management team of the company. This happens when the owner retires or a company divests, and the management of the company decide to lead the acquisition of the company. Sometimes, the team is the majority shareholder in the equity structuring part of the deal. In terms of risk, an MBO is at par with an OBO. The management is actually more informed than the non-executive owners of the state of the company. However, they might have less of a controlling perspective and might struggle to split their roles between management and governance, with conflicting views to handle. The risk profile of an MBO is therefore different from that in an OBO, but not necessarily higher. An MBO can be sponsored or unsponsored.
* The standard LBO is an _institutional buy-out_ (sometimes referred to simply as 'LBO', as this is the template of the operation): a fund (or group of funds) identifies a company for sale and acquires it thanks to the tax, financial and legal leverages. This happens when an owner (who is not a manager) retires and has no interest in staying on as an owner; or when a company divests from certain sectors. It is called an 'institutional' buy-out because the leader of the acquisition is the fund itself. The risk is higher as the historical owner(s) leave(s), and some of the corporate network, memory and culture disappears.
* A _leveraged buy-in_ (LBI) is when a fund acquires a business and has to immediately change or significantly overhaul the management. This happens when manager-owners leave the firm. The risk is higher as not only does the company lose its governance, but also its operational memory and know-how. Usually, a transition period is planned to facilitate the transfer of knowledge.
* A _management buy-in_ (MBI) is a company take-over by an outside management team. This is riskier than a standard LBI, as the management faces the same issuesas in an MBO, with the added hurdle of discovering the company in terms of operational management, while setting up the governance. An MBI can be sponsored or unsponsored.
* A _leveraged build-up_ (LBU) is structured to buy a company (the 'platform' company) and then later make additional acquisitions (the 'add-on(s)') to consolidate a sector and become an industry leader. This is probably the riskiest form of LBO, as the level of failure in mergers and acquisitions is significant. As the company operates these acquisitions under the constraint of repaying a significant debt and serving the interests, any mishap in delivering on the synergies will put the operation at risk.

Many combinations are possible, depending on the involvement of the management and its origin (insider or outsider). For example, a buy-in management buy-out (BIMBO) is an LBO which involves the entire - or parts of the - current management team and managers from the outside.

#### 4.1.3.2 Actors

LBO has been growing at a fast clip. Correlatively, actors have started to specialise - depending on the size of the companies targeted, the type of value creation programmes implemented, and sometimes by industries.

_LBO deal sizes and categories_

Expected LBO deal sizes determine LBO fund sizes. Fund managers have developed specific skillsets to address the most frequent issues faced by their portfolio companies. These issues are largely conditioned by the company size. As a given fund will operate 15 to 25 deals, the fund size is fairly easy to compute, by multiplying the average expected deal size by the expected number of deals in the fund, plus the sum of the management fees and other ancillary costs. When a deal fits the skills of a fund manager but is too large for the fund, then it is syndicated (as explained above, by structuring a club deals with competitors, or a co-investment with fund investors).

Deal sizes are segregated into small, mid-, large and mega LBOs. Unfortunately, the definition has evolved over time, and differs depending on the geographical region considered. Cambridge Associates defines the brackets as follows. Small LBO funds have a size of USD 350 million or less, mid-sized LBO funds have sizes above USD 350 million to a billion, large LBO funds are above USD 1 billion to 3.5 billion, and mega LBO funds have a size above USD 3.5 billion. At times, the mid-market is split between 'lower mid-market' and 'higher mid-market', the frontiers of which vary, but could be set at USD 350-500 million and then USD 500 million-1 billion.

Small and mid-sized LBO fund managers target local companies, with the aim of supporting them in their build-up (external growth through acquisitions), launching new products or services, facing an ownership transition, the structuring and professionalisation of their operations, and overall grow to the next stage. Small and medium-sized LBOs are often much closer to growth capital than large or mega LBOs. Not only is the financial structuring simpler, but the managerial and entrepreneurial questions are also much more important. Though large and mega LBO fund managers also support build-ups, they focus on refocusing companies, operational improvements, and at times value chain integration.

Small LBO fund managers have a local to national reach. Mid-sized specialists have a national or regional reach. Large and mega LBO fund managers have a wider reach, covering the USA or Western Europe. Some of them have a global approach. Mega fund managers often have a global reach.

When modern private equity was still nascent, some fund managers were until recently doing venture capital, growth capital and medium-sized LBOs within the same fund. This model, which was once applied on a national basis by Apax and on a European scale by 3i, has disappeared as teams specialised. It re-emerged as fund managers started to host separate teams each responsible for a specific strategy. For example, Adrian counts a fund of funds activity, a secondary team, an LBO team and a growth capital team.

_Listed LBO fund managers_

Some LBO fund managers are listed (Blackstone, Apollo and Carlyle, notably) and others have initially listed their funds (KKR, which later merged with the fund and related in New York). These groups are mainly active in the segment of very large international buy-outs (above the billion-dollar threshold). To invest in certain countries, they can cooperate with local investors. The American KKR has co-invested in France with the local LBO investor Wendel to buy Legrand (a EUR 1.4 billion operation in 2004).

Wendel itself is listed in France, just like 3i in the UK. These structures are in fact close to being holding companies, combining the investment structure and the manager into one unit.36 They do not have a planned lifetime (unlike most private equity funds). However, not all very large and large buy-out actors are listed: in the USA, Bain Capital and TPG are still private. Goldman Sachs is one of the few captive players owned by a bank. BC Partners and Permira, headquartered in the UK, specialise in very large buy-outs all over Europe and are private managers of unlisted private equity funds. On the continent, PAI Partners follows the same path.

Footnote 36: Other examples include Berkshire Hathaway in the USA, Softbank in Japan, Eurazeo in France, Gimv in Belgium or Investor AB in Sweden.

There are multiple reasons for listing funds. One of them is to avoid constant fundraising and spending time on road shows in order to convince prospective fund investors. Another is to be free from the pressure to sell a company in a given timeframe, and thus be able to time the exit of a given investment better.

However, these benefits also have drawbacks. The fund manager has to publish a great deal of information on his portfolio and he must also be ready to bear market scrutiny. Also, a listed structure can only raise funds in good times, when capital is abundant and when, furthermore, the valuations of portfolio companies are high. The value of the shares of the listed structure is significantly below the net asset value of its portfolio, 30-40% below in good times, 50-70% in difficult times. The market usually punishes the lack of perceived transparency in the structure.

Listed fund managers offer a way to set a price for fund manager stakes owned by exiting staff members, such as the founders or leading managing partners. As they own a

_Financial leverage_

The second leverage effect is _financial_. It is attributed to two cumulative phenomena:

1. The reduction of the debt of the holding company thanks to the payment of the target. The target company is acquired thanks to a debt contracted by the holding. As the target company is profitable, it is distributing dividends. These dividends are used to pay down the debt of acquisition and the related interests. As time goes by, the debt of acquisition is reduced to nil. This is theoretical, because often the maturity of the debt of acquisition goes beyond the average holding time of the portfolio company by the fund (via the holding company). In fact, the holding period spans from 3 to 5 years on average, whereas the maturity of the debt is often 6 to 8 years. This means that part of the debt of acquisition is then refunded at exit time thanks to the proceeds of the sale (or sometimes, the holding of the acquisition gets listed and the debt is then continued and paid by the company as usual until its term). Nevertheless, the debt is refunded thanks to the payments of the target, in the process increasing the value of the equity injected in the holding.
2. The difference between the cost of debt of the holding and the dividend yield of the target. If the dividend yield of the target is higher than the cost of debt, then the holding pockets the difference, often to refund the debt (or to distribute an anticipated profit).

The risk linked to the financial leverage will evolve over the course of the following years. The highest level of risk is at the beginning of the investment, as the financial leverage is the highest. Fund managers pay specific attention to this period of time, and set up a precise plan (the 'first 100-days plan' and pre-plan corrective measures if something does not go according to plan). The risk decreases with the debt as time goes by, except in the case of a dividend recapitalisation. This mechanism consists of re-leveraging the deal, using the extra debt as an early profit distributed to the fund (and thus the fund investors).

_Legal leverage_

The third leverage is _legal_. The structuring gives to the owner of the holding full control of the governance and the Board. If a fund solely owns 100% of the holding, then in effect the fund manager has the capacity to control very narrowly the execution of the LBO strategy by the management (in effect, it can go to the point of replacing the management if needed). If the holding is owned by private equity funds and the management of the company, then the situation changes and the legal leverage might be less effective. Nevertheless, it is very unusual that a fund (or a group of funds) does not own the majority of the holding to be able to exercise their political rights in the most efficient way.

_Structuring_

The maximum amount which is borrowed is not fixed in advance. It depends first and foremost on the cash flows generated by the target. It depends then on cost of debt (the interest rate), and on the appreciation of the risks of the LBO by the lender. Four dimensions are thus involved: the amount borrowed, the cost of the debt, the duration and the legal guarantees (the 'covenants'), providing the lender with information instruments to monitor the debt.

LBO deals are usually structured by one fund, which can then invite other funds to co-invest with the lead investor ('club deals'). Some LBO funds are dedicated to minority investments (either as part of an LBO consortium or as providers of replacement capital, see above). Consortia of acquisition are frequent when the target reaches a certain size, notably if it is listed. Each fund manager brings its connections and know-how to participate in the take-over offering (this has led to some accusations of collusion and anti-competitive behaviours, see above).

_Value creation_

LBOs are often accused of being a source of 'asset stripping', where companies are acquired to be dismembered and sold in small pieces. Though these operations were frequent in the 1980s, it is unlikely to be the case today. Figure 4.32 later shows that far from squeezing resources from portfolio companies, LBO investors actually increase the capital expenditures (i.e., investments), marketing expenditures and R&D of their portfolio companies.

Figure 4.28 exhibits the type of value creation that an LBO investor provides to its portfolio company. Not surprisingly, the financial performance comes first, but financial advice, bouncing ideas and contributing to the strategy, increasing the scrutiny of operations and finances (presumably to take action) are part of the value creation. Basically, an LBO challenges the status quo in a firm, to find sources of value creation and materialise them to sell a company at a higher price.

The fact that the exit scenario implies a higher price means that it is very unlikely that the LBO operation will have as its sole purpose the exercise of a financial leverage (though that can happen). The future buyer of the company must buy an asset which has grown in value for him (hence sometimes the divestment projects, to focus a company on a specific market and make it compatible with the strategy of a conglomerate). This growth in value can be driven by a growth in sales (e.g., launching a new product/service or tapping the marketing opportunities), as exhibited in Figure 4.29.

The growth in value of a company is often increased by improving its efficiency (e.g., setting up a leaner production, identifying gluts and releasing them, arbitraging between outsourcing or insourcing functions), as shown in Figure 4.30. Figure 4.31 illustrates the different tools used by LBO fund managers to create value, at the different stages of the operation.

Figure 4.28: Contributions of LBO investors after investing

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:199]

A summary of three different studies38 by Quiry and Le Fur (2010) states that on average, the equity investment of LBO funds is multiplied by 2.72 over a holding period of 3.5 years (an IRR of 48%). Excluding outliers, the median IRR is 33%. At entry, the debt/EBITDA ratio is shown in Figure 4.30 and at exit it is 2.7. The 2.72 multiplier of value can be broken down as follows:

Footnote 38: Achleitner (2009), Acharya, Hahn and Kehoe (2010), Brigl _et al._ (2008).

1. A financial leverage (debt) explains 0.89 of the 2.72 (that is to say, a third of the performance).
2. An increase of the multiples (EV/EBITDA) explains 0.47 (that is to say, 17%).
3. The rest is from operational improvement - increase of the EBITDA (29%, of which 77% is due to an increase of the turn-over and 23% to an increase of margins) and increase of cash flows to reduce the debt of acquisition (15%). Figure 4.32 illustrates the effective use of the different tools by general partners. However, Mariathasan (2011) wonders where the growth is going to come from in the future, notably in Europe. Schwartz (2012) argues that it will be efficiency that will drive private equity's success (hence reducing the 'frictions' in the economy).

The period 1989-2000 witnessed a higher creation of operational value, while 2001-2006 has seen a higher impact of financial leverages. The best IRRs came from investments made in difficult times (1991-1993 and 2001-2003), while most of the operational improvements came from the growth of turn-over.

According to Quiry and Le Fur (2010), excluding financial leverage, LBOs outperform investments in listed companies by 600 basis points (LBO IRRs are 31%, while for listed companies they are 2.5%). The gross IRR of LBO fund managers is hence 31% and after carried interest (20%) and management fees (2%), the net IRR is 25% (that is to say, the same as investing in listed companies). These conclusions are subject to caution but illustrate a specific trend of the academic literature which vigorously denies any net value creation from LBOs.

Corporate governance and management incentives are major drivers of value creation. LBO fund managers are creating performance when:

* Principals are specialised in certain economic sectors that they know very well.
* Principals are very focused on specific questions, as their learning curve is reduced.
* Principals have a strong ability to identify early investment opportunities, as they can resume the process of acquisition faster.

The Boston Consulting Group has in fact identified six operating models for general partners of LBO funds (see Figure 4.33). The in-house operating teams have been gaining ground according to Bain Capital 2019, leading fund managers to line up successively deal teams and operational improvement teams.

Figure 4.34 demonstrates the role of the LBO in the private equity ecosystem, notably as a 'breathing factor' for the stock exchange. It also helps non-listed groups with the succession plans of their owners or with the restructuring of their shareholding structure. Some market observers have announced that for a certain time there will be an increasing volume of activities linked to a generational change at the helm of

private groups. This does not necessarily imply a radical change of ownership, but can involve funds to help the current owner in the sale of his stake. LBO fund managers bring know-how, offer ways to reinforce the management structure and finances, and promote the development of these companies.

##### 4.1.3.4 Challenges and Limits

There is a limit to what LBO funds can do. Not every company can be a target for LBO funds, as it needs to have stable and recurring cash flows. These cash flows will come under pressure in the event of an LBO operation.

_The commoditisation of LBO techniques and its consequences_

Still, the multiplication of LBOs in mid-sized companies, and the perspectives of consolidation, have a real impact on the American and European economic landscapes. The multiplication of LBO funds, the inflation of the capital to be deployed by fund managers, the professionalism of sellers and intermediaries, as well as the strong increase in the number of deals done have contributed to the inflation of company valuations.

In fact, by accelerating the transmission of companies and restructuring economic sectors rapidly, it is possible that the LBO will experience further changes. The technique of LBOs has become a commodity and the 'easy target' companies have already largely

Figure 4.34: Lifecycle of a company and LBO

been targeted by an LBO. It seems quite improbable that LBO fund managers will be able to structure deals without any value creation (see above).

This excess of liquidity has granted LBO fund managers the cash to structure very large operations such as Kinder Morgan (USD 22.4 billion), HCA (USD 32.7 billion), Equity Office Properties (USD 38.9 billion) or even TXU (USD 43.8 billion). In 2006, 80 deals reached the billion threshold (as opposed to 12 in 2002). Some of these companies were in a difficult situation during the crisis, and LBO fund managers are supposed to help them weather the storm. This can prove difficult, as even industrials sometimes fail to succeed in this task. The acquisition and further sale to a private equity fund of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz is one of those examples. An acquisition without restructuring and dedicated and appropriate monitoring can simply lead the resulting group into more difficulties. LBO fund managers are not necessarily handling these troubled groups better, and the case of Chrysler is only one illustration. Table 4.5 provides some background on how the LBOs from the bubble years have fared.

Restructuring gives birth to new companies or new subsidiaries, which can be deal opportunities for growth capital or LBO funds. This was illustrated by Clear Channel selling its TV stations to Providence Equity Partners in 2007.

_An increased connection between LBO deals activity and the debt markets_

The availability of LBO debt has been reduced dramatically since 2007-2008 (see Figure 4.35), hence reducing the number of deals (see Figure 4.36). LBO activity has decreased significantly in 2008. In Europe, LBO loan volumes represented less than 25% of the total in 2007 (which reached USD 290 billion, according to Dealogic). With the time lag owing to the conclusion of transactions that were signed in 2007 but effectively realised in 2008, the 2008 volume has to be discounted by a further 30%. In the USA, volumes have decreased by 80%, from USD 379 billion to USD 77 billion. In Europe and the USA, these figures can be compared to the pre-bubble situation (i.e., the period 2004-2005).

This specific case illustrates how LBOs depend heavily on the state of the debt markets. These debt markets are composite: small and mid-sized LBOs rely on debt provided and held by banks, while large and mega LBOs rely on debt structured by investment banks and later sold to high-yield bond specialists. This means that small and mid-sized LBOs are more constrained in their leverage structures, but also more resilient to crises. Large and mega LBOs can be structured more creatively and aggressively, but suffer in a context of low appetite for risky debt instruments.

_LBO segments post financial crisis: a moderate recovery..._

Figure 4.37 illustrates the resilience of the small LBO segment. The mid-market shrank significantly but remained active. This figure shows that indeed large and mega LBOs had almost disappeared in 2009, but recovered relatively well in 2010.

Figure 4.38 shows that the volume of activity recovered to a robust level, while the amounts considered remain rather low (half of the peak of 2007). Interestingly, the average equity contribution to the deal decreased as soon as the mega LBOs picked up, hence confirming that the debt-to-equity ratio for mega LBOs is higher than for other deals.

_... in a split debt market, with low interest rates..._

In fact, there is a widening gap between LBO debt provided by banks (a shrinking pool, due to the Basel Agreements and the overall de-leveraging of banks' balance sheets) and debt provided by financial markets, which is expanding due to a certain thirst for returns from bond investors, in a context of low interest rates.

The usual targets of small LBOs see their attractiveness increase sharply in the wake of the rise of company valuations, notably due to increased activity in buy-and-build. This is very visible when a market approaches its peak (Figure 4.39). Multiples are lower than for big companies and financial levers are more moderate, but the impact

Notably, small LBOs can capitalise on an increase for the multiples of EBIT (or equivalently, to calculate the price of the company sold) as the company has reduced its intrinsic risk and acquired a certain size. The volume of add-on acquisitions has increased fairly regularly since 1996 (Figures 4.40 and 4.41).

As an alternative to build-up strategies, large LBO fund managers started to specialise more (building, for example, internal consulting practices, providing mutualised purchasing services for all their portfolio companies) or focus on finding new areas of intervention (e.g., in certain regulated jobs). They feel a significant pressure to do so, as

the price of investment opportunities has increased significantly over time. The average purchase price multiple for US LBOs was 7.3\(\times\) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) in 2004, reached 9.9\(\times\) in 2007 and decreased to 8.6\(\times\) in 2009 (see Figure 4.42). These multiples remained stable from 2010 at 9.0-9.3\(\times\) but started to increase again in 2014 and reached 10.9-11.0\(\times\) in 2017-2018 from 6.5-6.9\(\times\) in 2000-2003 to 8.4\(\times\) in 2006. Overall, the multiple of debt proceeds followed the increase of the multiple of purchase price, as shown in Figure 4.42. The increase in prices was largely financed by an increase in debt, not by an increase in equity, despite guidance from the US and European regulators to limit the debt leverage to 6\(\times\) EBITDA. How do fund managers reconcile an increase in debt levels and the regulatory informal cap? By adding back to EBITDA calculations elements such as expected synergies or non-recurring factors, so that the debt fits in the guidelines.

This is notably due to the fact that debt remains cheap (when available) and the equity available for private equity funds (the 'dry powder') is of high quantity as well (see Figure 4.43). According to Bain/Preqin, roughly USD 2 trillion was available for private equity investments at the time of writing. Of this amount, 35% is for LBO investments.

_The emphasis on divestments is unabated..._

Exits are more than ever an important topic. Some of the commitments of fund investors rely on the assumed liquidity of the current portfolios to be recycled in new funds. A lack of liquidity events can put fund investors in a liquidity squeeze, hence forcing them to sell other assets or to divest from some of their private equity funds. However, after the financial crisis, a new phenomenon appeared: net positive distributions (Figure 4.44). Fund investors have to maintain an exposure to private markets. If fund managers dispose of assets too fast and return capital to fund investors, then the latter record an effective under-allocation to private equity compared to their target.

Figure 4.42: LBO valuations in multiples of EBITDA in the USA and breakdown between debt and equity

To find a lucrative exit, the choices are:

* To resell the companies in question to strategic investors (trade sale) at a higher price (including the payment of a premium). Some groups are difficult to sell because the prices are too high for industrial groups, which cannot find synergies and industrial perspectives in order to get an acceptable return in acquiring these companies. This is the most frequent exit scenario (see Figure 4.45 for an illustration with LBO).
* To sell them to another financial investor (secondary sale, or'sponsor-to-sponsor'). One of the consequences of a high level of 'dry powder' is the resilient activity of

Figure 4.44: Aggregated cash inflows and outflows of LBO funds globally _Source:_ Bain, Cambridge Associates 2019.

Figure 4.43: Committed and uninvested capital (‘dry powder’) in private equity _Source:_ Bain, Preqin 2019.

secondary operations, as shown in Figure 4.45. This is true for secondary, tertiary, quaternary, etc. LBOs, but also increasingly in the case of VC investments sold to LBOs (Demos, 2012). This has become the second most frequent exit scenario.
* To list them on the stock exchange (IPO) at a high multiple (which is difficult to assume, as stock exchanges can be in a down cycle). This is the least frequent scenario.

In case of failure, the alternative is to restructure them. This can lead to cost cutting when the market does not show the expected growth, and eventually to asset sales in the case of declining cash flows. This is one of the reasons why LBO funds are sometimes identified as specialists in downsizing, with the social consequences attached to it. After focusing on the restructuring of some of their portfolio companies in 2009-2010, trade sales have recovered (though moderately) as well as the IPO market. If this does not work, then investments are written off. The ownership of companies is transferred to the creditors in case of LBOs, or at times directly liquidated. A failed VC investment generally leads to a direct liquidation (that is to say, the sale of the remaining assets and the termination of the company).

_... leading potentially to excesses: dividend recaps are an illustration_

Cheap debt has also helped fund managers do recapitalisations (or 'dividend recaps'), which are another (criticisable) way to provide liquidity to fund investors. The principle of dividend recaps is simple: a private equity fund acquires a healthy company through an LBO. Theoretically, this company should be sold after a few years, which was in fact not possible due to the past crisis. The leverage effect decreasing over time (the debt of acquisition being regularly repaid), there is still the option to re-leverage and distribute 'anticipated profits' to fund investors.

Theoretically, dividend recaps are putting everyone at ease. Fund managers can please fund investors with distributions, and hence prepare comfortably their next

Figure 4.45: Exit from LBO globally

fundraising. The underlying company has no right to voice any concern, but its management is relatively pleased to avoid any additional pressure to find a trade buyer which does not exist at that time. Fund investors get cash in a period when liquidity and rates are low. Dividend recaps ease concerns when holding periods are creeping up, as was the case after the recession of 2007-2009 (Figure 4.46). In that respect, dividend recaps have contributed to the net distributions illustrated above in Figure 4.43, but the duration of ownership had remained substantially higher. In 2010, USD 234 billion was granted in leverage loans (vs USD 77 billion in 2009) according to S&P LCD. 84% of these loans were granted to distribute dividends to private equity funds. Clearwire Communications and HCA, among the largest LBOs of the 2006-2007 bubble, were the target of dividend recaps.

Dividend recaps have two main consequences. The first is to add risks in existing LBO deals. In a classical LBO structuring, the highest point of the risk is during the first months, when financial leverage is high. Theoretically, this risk is compensated by the added value which will be created by the investor. Re-leveraging is not compensated by an additional value creation - it is a 'wait and see' solution.

The second aspect is that these dividend recaps have the inconvenience that they 'break the return thermometer', that is to say, they may suddenly skew one of the private equity fund return measurements: the IRR. A small example (see Table 4.6) shows that an anticipated cash distribution by a dividend recap can simultaneously increase the IRR and impoverish the investor: the investor realises an IRR of 20% and multiplies his investment by 3, while the investor who realises an IRR of 26% multiplies his investment by 2.5.

The classical answer of fund managers is that fund investors will always prefer liquidity to increased performance. This remains to be proven. First, there is no guarantee that fund investors will find an investment opportunity performing at the same level as the original deal. Second, the transaction costs to find and invest in an LBO of the same quality will lower the overall performance of the fund investors' portfolio.

#### 4.1.4 Special Situations: Turn-around Capital38
Footnote 38: Special situations include various niche strategies beyond turn-around capital. Given the lack of data on turn-around capital itself, we will use data for special situation funds as a proxy for turn-around capital.

The inflation of company valuations was an incentive for some LBO fund managers to widen the spectrum of their interventions. Some teams have initially specialised in regulated sectors (e.g., Carlyle in the USA). Other fund managers, such as Butler Capital Partners in France, have targeted companies with specific problems (working capital shortage, imbalanced balance sheet or temporary insolvency), operating turn-around investments.

Turn-around capital (also known as rescue capital), which targets ailing businesses before their effective bankruptcy, is still a niche, overshadowed by distressed debt investments (see below). The two are often blended together, but differ. Turn-around capital is about new investors buying the equity of an ailing business for a symbolic amount. Sometimes the new owners are paid by the current ones (sellers) to restructure the business out of court, thus avoiding an expensive and sometimes unpredictable outcome in bankruptcy courts. The sellers avoid issues such as reputational damage (bankruptcy is a public legal process), but also operational difficulties. Clients and providers of an ailing business can continue to work with the company operating as a going concern, while its issues are sorted out. Indeed, suppliers and creditors could be reluctant to maintain business relationships with the company under administration.

In some pre-bankruptcy procedures (at times referred to as 'pre-packed bankruptcies'), the intervention of external administrators is supporting the restructuring. Sometimes, the arrangement between the company and its creditors is approved by a court. This is the case for example in the UK, with the scheme of arrangement (also known as'scheme of reconstruction'). The arrangement altering the creditors and shareholders rights is therefore approved by a judicial authority.

One of the benefits for the buyer of an ailing business is that it usually has accumulated significant losses, which will become in effect a tax shield for the profits of the restructured business until these losses are fully compensated. Turn-around capital therefore benefits from a tax leverage close to the one described above for LBO.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & **Without dividend recap** & **With dividend recap** \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{l}{_Initial investment_} & \(-100\) & \(-100\) \\ Year 1 & 0 & 0 \\ Year 2 & 0 & 0 \\ Year 3 & 0 & 150 \\ Year 4 & 0 & 0 \\ Year 5 & 0 & 0 \\ Year 6 & 300 & 100 \\ Multiple of investment & 3 & 2.5 \\ IRR & 20\% & 26\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4.6: Multiples and IRRs of an investment with and without dividend recapThe appetite for this type of investment is very opportunistic. This activity is a niche that is not widely documented. Preqin estimated that as of 2016, 47 fund managers were active in this strategy. North America represents roughly 70% of the market, and Europe the rest. This investment strategy is very sensitive to the macro-economic conditions, but also somehow decorrelated from the rest of the private equity investment universe (see Table 7 - though this focuses on hedge funds dedicated to distressed situations, and Figure 47 showing the IRRs of special situations depending on the vintage years of the fund). Turn-around investments perform very well when acquisitions are made during or right after a recession (as in 2001), and then under-perform when investments are done in boom times (as in 1996-1999). They are therefore a useful strategy to build a balanced and diversified asset allocation.

This is reflected by the fundraising figures. Figure 48 illustrates that the amounts committed increased in 2007 and 2008, probably in expectation of a bubble burst.

Though 2009 was affected by the crisis as much as the rest of the private equity sector, there was vigorous activity in terms of fundraising in 2010-2012: fund investors expected a further downturn, probably when the quantitative easing waves would have stopped and the economy had restructured (either in the USA or Europe, with expectations as reflected in Figure 4.49). As a result, turn-around funds in Europe raised a record amount in 2011.

Opportunities in Europe could have been significant (see _Financial Times_, 2011a),40 as European banks usually suffer for a long time from the aftermath of the crisis (notably in Spain after the crisis of 2007-2009; see White, 2012) and would require alternatives to dispose of non-performing loans. Opportunities have not materialised in a "wave" (_The Economist_, 2012b)41 due to the special programmes undertaken by central banks and governments after the crisis.

Footnote 40: As mentioned: Thomas Cook, Premier Foods, Seat Piagine Gialle, Eksportfinans, La Senza.

Footnote 41: So far, however, distressed-debt investors have been disappointed. “There’s not been a deluge [in Europe], we had been hoping for a deluge”, was the recent verdict of Howard Marks, Oaktree’s chairman.’

In any case, Europe has still to find its own model of turn-around capital, and is therefore following the USA on the path to offering full support to companies over the course of their lifetime (see Figure 4.50). Continental Europe does not have the equivalent of the American Chapter 11, which means that turn-around capital is the only option for companies in difficulty to restructure with the help of professional investors. Most of the time, when a company asks for bankruptcy protection, it is too late to find another solution (see Milne, 2012 explaining that the troubled airliner SAS would have benefitted from the equivalent of the US Chapter 11).

Figure 4.48: Fundraising in special situations (2005–08/2012)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:218]

However, regulations are not the only obstacle to the emergence of this kind of business. Some successes in turn-around did not involve a financial backer, such as the lingerie company Aubade in France. An entrepreneur bought the ailing brand and redeveloped it with a specific positioning. It is the ability to take risks and adopt an entrepreneurial attitude, even in a difficult context, which will eventually change the course of the company.

The shame associated with the bankruptcy procedure is widely blamed, notably on the Continent. European cultures and regulations are still refraining CEOs of troubled businesses from asking for the protection of the courts and trying to find a solution. Moreover, turn-around capital does not necessarily fit with the private equity constraints in Europe. More specifically, most of the actors involved in these sorts of private equity activities in Europe are using holding companies - not private equity fund structures. The take-over, restructuring and exit process would take more time than is manageable in a 10-year structure. Another element is that turn-around investors have usually set up an industrial approach, which offers services to businesses to help them through restructuring.

#### Aiming at the Margins? Interacting with the Stock Exchange and its Ecosystem

Private equity is not limited to unlisted securities. This is the case with PIPEs and delistings (or 'public-to-private').

_Private investments in public equities_

The purpose of PIPEs is to take a mid- to long-term stake in a listed company which is struggling to raise capital on the stock exchange. A private equity (usually growth capital) fund invests in exchange of specific advantages, such as a lower price per share at acquisition than the market price, and the seats on the Board. The fund agrees to hold these shares ('lock up') for a predefined minimum time during which the company will make significant changes. Once the changes are made, and the lock-up period expires, the fund is free to sell its stake on the open market.

_Public-to-privates_

Private equity funds sometimes take control of listed companies in order to delist them. The purpose of this operation is to give back some flexibility to the company and restructure it more easily. Local laws often specify acquiring at least 90% or more of a listed company, to force minority shareholders to sell their shares ('squeeze out'). Hedge funds can find interest in acquiring a stealth blocking minority position and negotiating a premium to pave the way for a successful delisting by the private equity fund.

Public-to-private (such as HCA, Kinder Morgan, Univision or Petco) deals, though attractive in boom times, present some difficulties - such as regulatory costs, a high purchase price, closing risks, threats of stockholder litigation and reverse break-up fees (Weisser & Germano, 2006).

Large listed groups are no longer immune from take-overs by LBO funds. Vivendi, one of the largest European listed companies, was eventually named in 2006-2007 as a potential target at EUR 40 billion by KKR.

The Alternative Credit Council estimates that it could reach USD 1 trillion by 2020.

#### 4.2.1 Senior Lending: Direct Lending and Unitranche

Also called 'alternative credit', 'private credit' or'senior debt', direct lending could be considered as equivalent to the senior lending activity operated by banks. The activity consists of providing usually small and mid-sized businesses with loans, but the difference with bank loans is that the purpose of the operation is specific. While banks provide loans to do more of the same, such as for example producing more or opening a new shop, direct lending usually finances unusual and often one-off operations.

Direct lending in effect finances the launch of a subsidiary abroad, or of a new product/service, or even an acquisition. This type of risk is difficult to assess for a bank, as it is very specific. Scoring is thus difficult or impossible. Direct lending fund managers apply techniques that are closer to the private equity toolbox. They undertake due diligence, which implies meeting with the management and going beyond a pure documentation analysis. The perimeter of this due diligence varies depending on the fund manager, but can extend to market and competition analysis.

Direct/senior/unitranche debt is provided by active fund managers carefully assessing risks thanks to a due diligence. Besides active risk assessment and mitigation by the fund manager, the downside risk protection of direct/senior and unitranche debt funds come from the fact that they have a first claim on assets and strong covenants (that is, clauses to monitor and enforce the loan terms). These covenants are crucial to manage risks and act in case the borrower experiences financial difficulties.

Not surprisingly, direct lending fund managers operate essentially in countries with stable and low inflation rates, with strong and predictable legal environments, and where courts can rule relatively fast and judgements can be enforced without major hurdles. Developed markets, namely the USA but also more recently Western Europe, are the main locations of this type of activity.

The USA has a rather long history of providing alternative forms of credit to companies, notably by using bonds, structured credit instruments and securitisation of loan portfolios. American direct lending fund managers also offered an alternative to banks, even before 2008. This activity has been developing fast, particularly since the financial crisis of 2008-2009. International regulatory frameworks such as the Basel III Agreements, as well as major overhauls of national banking legislation, have redefined the perimeter of the lending activity of banks. Notably, these regulations have reset risk thresholds for banks and adjusted solvency ratios to these new assumptions. As a consequence, banks have retreated from lending activities, and reduced significantly their lending activity to small and mid-sized businesses. Lending to these businesses was perceived as less profitable due to the increased costs of risk analysis and compliance, while risk assessments were less favourable to these businesses.

development of the the development of theMexzanine debt is often compared to leveraged loans, as both are provided to companies with no rating - or rated below investment grade, such as the ones targeted by LBOs. However, leveraged loans are usually collateralised and thus senior, whereas mezzanine debt is not (as it is subordinated). Leveraged loans are usually provided by banks, which keep them to maturity or more frequently package and resell them (notably as collateralised loan obligations, see below). According to some estimates, the leveraged loans market in the USA reached USD 1 trillion in 2018 and is on the verge of catching up with high-yield bonds (USD 1.1 trillion).

Mezzanine debt can theoretically be provided by banks but is in practice provided by non-traditional lenders such as mezzanine funds. The mezzanine debt can be'sponsored' if the equity provider is a financial institution such as an LBO fund. The fund acquires a company (via one or multiple holding companies, see above) and places the mezzanine debt in one/the holding company. However, the mezzanine debt can also be 'unsponsored' if there is no intervention of a financial institution as an equity provider. The owner can, for example, be the management of the business.

Mezzanine debt is provided by active fund managers, who carefully assess the risk associated with the borrower and its business. This is not a credit-scoring approach, but a full due diligence operated by the fund manager, in partnership with the equity provider in case of sponsored mezzanine. As a result, the loss ratio is supposed to be minimal or nil. Mezzanine debt provides an exposure to the upside of LBOs (in case of sponsored operations) while limiting the risks associated with this type of operation. This strategy provides investors with the opportunity to get an exposure to transfers of ownership of mid- to mega-size deals, including those that are not sponsored by LBO funds. The investment universe is therefore partially diverging from LBO funds.

Mezzanine debt is popular with lenders, because the interest rates are higher than for senior debt and there is potential for conversion. It is also popular for borrowers, because it means having debt without bearing repayment over the course of the holding period. Even if the interest rate is higher for mezzanine than for senior and junior debt, it is still perceived as 'cheap' because of the repayment _in fine_.

Mezzanine debt is relatively expensive when compared to senior debt. During the last credit cycle (until 2008), subordinated non-convertible debt emerged as an alternative: the second lien debt (sometimes referred to as 'junior debt'). Unlike mezzanine debt, which aims to generate a gross IRR of 15-18%, second lien aims for 10-12% gross IRR.

According to Partners Group, mezzanine debt has shown a certain stability during the financial crisis (the average volatility was 11%, against 50-60% for other asset classes, see Figure 4.51). In case of default, the debt is usually recovered at around 50%. Historically, the recovery rate is high, with a default rate of 2-4% (in 2008, it culminated at 12-13%).

_Second lien debt_

Other instruments - such as'second lien' loans, which are the equivalent of mezzanine debt without conversion rights - are competing with mezzanine debt. Second lien debt rose on the premise that mezzanine debt was not deemed to be converted owing to shorter holding periods. It was thus better to opt simply for another layer of debt, which would come after the senior and junior debt. Senior debt has the highest priority regarding repayment and junior debt comes next, generally after a certain number of years and sometimes depending on certain criteria. Because of this mechanism, second lien was structured to be converted _in fine_. Figure 4.52 illustrates the fast growth of the second lien loan market.

At the height of the last investment cycle, large/mega LBO investments were increasingly structured to bear _in fine_ debt repayments, thus increasing the need for mezzanine and second lien debts. The second lien loan market presents many advantages for large/mega LBO fund managers. The repayment _in fine_, either by tranches or

in total ('bullet'), even if it is a source of increasing valuation of the companies, is also a source of flexibility. The underlying portfolio company does not have to repay the debt before term. As the riskiest moment of an LBO is the first year, this means that repayment _in fine_ happens when the company has more latitude to repay it.

_Covenant strong or covenant light debt_

The credit crisis has had many consequences, among them an economic downturn. This has obviously affected LBO funds' portfolio companies, which are supposed to reimburse the debt of acquisition through dividend payments. With sales and results under pressure, these portfolio companies struggle to make the dividend payments. As a result, defaults on payments have increased by a multiple of 3.6 between 2007 and 2008, with an estimated 5.8% default on European leveraged loans in the first semester of 2009.

A default in repayment usually triggers the potential transfer of ownership of the portfolio company from the fund to the bank(s). To avoid that, debts are usually restructured prior to that extreme. Debt restructuring is usually triggered by breach of covenants. Lenders and owners gather to review the reimbursement plan, according to a new development plan, which takes into account the new economic conditions.

For that reason, the volume of debt restructuring is probably as meaningful, in that respect, as the defaults on payments. A comparison of restructuring and defaults over the course of 2004-2009 shows that although defaults remain high for the first 2 months of 2009, the proportion of restructuring has increased significantly.

What makes debt restructuring successful is the assumption that the value of the company remains higher than the total of the debt of acquisition, and that the development plan will eventually bring significant income to pay the outstanding debt. It can involve a change in the loan mix, with a transfer of principal repayment _in fine_, for example.

Debt restructuring can also be the only way to face portfolio companies' difficulties, as the covenants of the debt may not trigger direct ownership by the lenders. As the difficulties appear earlier, hinting implicitly that the risk of structuring is far too high, the banks grant non-restructuring waivers more easily. The reason is that most of the banks do not want to book high losses, notably when there is a chance of recovery for the company. They also want to avoid becoming owners of ailing businesses.

Of the 64 companies which had covenant-related difficulties in 2008, 48% were breaches of covenant, 34% were redefinitions or waivers of covenant, 3% were an equity increase to prevent a breach of covenant and 14% restructured their debt owing to a breach of covenant. According to S&P, 2009-2012 was a period of acceleration of financial restructuring of leverage loans, and of increased breaches of covenant. The trend is particularly impressive, with a strong acceleration of amendments and waivers of covenant in 2009. As a consequence, 75% of American banks have increased their requirements as to covenants and have been more restrictive in the allocation of leveraged loans in 2008, according to the Federal Reserve (Bank for International Settlements, 2008). Logically, the allocation of covenant light loans dried up in 2009.

However, as soon as the effects of the crisis were gone, the covenant light loans came back (Primack, 2011; Burne, 2012). The low level of interest rates and investors' third for yield is driving this trend (Demos and Lauricella, 2012 illustrate this trend with'master limited partnerships' structured to own real assets such as coal mines and gas stations).44

Footnote 44: According to Barclays (quoted in Demos and Lauricella, 2012), the market for MLPs had grown from USD 65 billion to more than USD 350 billion in 2012.

Figure 4.53 depicts the evolution of the debt structure, with a decline of the fully secured debt from more than 80% to slightly more than 50% in 3 years. The rise of _covenant light_ debt is impressive, given the short time over which it has developed. In that respect, the competitive pressure on banks has somehow promoted this segment of private equity loans to the rank of a bubble indicator (Tett, 2007).

The current credit cycle has seen the quasi-elimination of mezzanine and second lien debt as we know it in favour of so-called unitranche debt (see above). Mezzanine financing (as well as unitranche and senior debt) is essentially available in developed markets, with the USA and Europe representing the bulk. Mezzanine debt represents roughly 11% of PD funds and 2% of PM funds.

#### Distressed Debt

Distressed debt (DD) funds can be split into two categories: debt-for-trading and debt-for-control (also called 'loan-to-own'). Debt-for-trading is applied by hedge funds as they acquire the debt of an ailing business at a discount, expecting events to materialise for the business to recover and eventually selling the debt at a higher price. This is a hands-off strategy that requires liquid debt markets to operate.

DD investors dedicated to loan-to-own, such as in private debt funds, buy specific tranches of the debt of an ailing business at a discount with the target of eventually taking control of the business by converting some or all of this debt into equity. In the

Figure 4.53: Evolution of the covenant light loan market

process, equity investors will be washed out, DD investors will restructure the company to profitability and then sell it once its renewed viability is demonstrated. In private debt, DD refers to this hands-on loan-to-own strategy.

Restructuring a company is a high risk-return activity. Investors have tried to lower the risks associated with dealing with troubled companies, and also to enter the company earlier than its actual bankruptcy procedure (turn-around capital, see above). One of the ways to reconcile these two aims is to look at the liabilities of these ailing companies, and notably also their bank debts. Some companies have trouble repaying their debts, even if their fundamentals are sound and solid. US fund managers approach debt holders to acquire their debts at a discount. The seller of the debt could clear their books, register a loss and deploy their funding capacities elsewhere.

DD funds usually use the rights attached to holding the debt to negotiate with the management and the equity holders a sharp restructuring of the company. If successful, this operation would provide a significant benefit to the distressed debt holder, while protecting them from a full loss if the recovery does not happen. Oaktree Capital Management is one of the firms which have developed such strategies in the USA.

Whether with DD investing or turn-around capital, the new owner generally provides additional financial and specialist human resources, negotiates with the creditors and restructures the business according to a specific plan. However, to be viable, this activity has to be undertaken early on, soon after the business starts to experience difficulties. Often, business owners acknowledge these difficulties late, beyond the point at which DD or turn-around investing remains potentially successful.

The value creation attached to distressed debt is linked to the fact that banks are not usually able to handle an ailing business. Not only may the debt not give them a right to truly influence the management, but they are also usually not prepared for this eventuality. This is also why banks participating in LBO debts generally call for a renegotiation of the covenants of the debt rather than triggering the clauses which will entitle them to own the collateral (i.e., the business which was taken over thanks to the debt they provided). Here, the competition with hedge funds is clearly evident.

To operate, DD funds rely on appropriate bankruptcy procedures such as Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, which is the most widely used in DD investing. It provides a list of the desirable criteria to see the emergence of such strategies in other jurisdictions. First, Chapter 11 freezes all debt repayment and interest due by the business placed in bankruptcy. This grants the business and its administrators a relief period during which it is possible to assess the options to restructure the business (or its liquidation, which falls under Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Code).

Then, Chapter 11 places a judicial authority in charge of the process, notably to decide on specific issues related to the restructuring of the business. This authority can take specific actions such as approving a restructuring plan even if a minority of creditors do not. This authority can also reduce the capital of the company (thus washing out the former owners) and increase it by converting debt that was not originally designed to be converted.

Furthermore, Chapter 11 does not create any hierarchy between creditors besides the contractual seniority of the different tranches of debt. This provides potential buyers of the credit of the company a relatively clear picture of the tranches of debt to buy in order to have sufficient collateral in case of failure of the business, as well as to be able to force the restructuring of the business along a specific plan. For that matter, the buyer of the credit has to acquire a specific quantity of debt to reach a given majority.

Some jurisdictions, such as France, make a distinction by granting privileges to administrative bodies (tax and social administration), for example. In this case, these administrative bodies are not inclined to sell their debt at a discount. As a consequence, it is impossible for potential credit buyers to acquire the relevant tranches of debt and lead the restructuring.

_Limits in Europe_

Some jurisdictions, such as the UK, offer a similar bankruptcy regime and could emerge as a potential market for DD investors. More recently, India has reformed its bankruptcy regime to facilitate operations, shorten the process and possibly offer business under administration a way out of the process, notably thanks to the involvement of DD investors.

The UK is ranked as having the best legislation regarding creditor protection, ahead of Germany and France (Davydenko & Franks, 2006). It even allows the organisation of pre-packaged administration procedures (Scott, 2012), which make it easier to turn around a business (but in the process these pre-packaged processes leave the creditors in a difficult situation). In France, the priority given to the continuity of business and job protection reduces creditor protection. In the UK, first-ranking creditors have a right of veto on the decisions made by the directors upon default of payment from the company. They control the company from that moment on. In Germany, creditors are in the middle ground, in the sense that they retain a certain power in restructuring loans.

The consequence is that in the UK, the recovery rate is 92%, as opposed to 67% in Germany and 56% in France. All else being equal, the difference between the UK and France is that the recovery rate is 20% higher in the former. One interpretation is that the incentive for British banks to do their best to ensure that companies progress towards a positive outcome is higher, as they have a better prospect of recovering their debts.

Countries without an equivalent of Chapter 11 have limited activity in turn-around capital investing (see above). This type of operation is executed to avoid a formal bankruptcy procedure.

_An alternative to distressed debt investing: non-performing loans_

Banks structure their loans to maximise their risk-return profile in a given legal environment. In that respect, bankruptcy codes play a major role in the way creditors are reacting to default on debt, and also in how this debt is being handled afterwards. Banks have increasingly decided to keep the debt of defaulting companies, and thus become the new owners of these businesses (this was emblematic with Citi seizing a defaulting EMI from Terra Firma, and then auctioning it off to two trade buyers in 2012). These companies are sound, but they were acquired through an excess of leverage. As a result, European banks are injecting capital to help these companies with the double prospect of recovering their loans and eventually making a profit out of these defaulting companies (Cauchi, 2009).

An emerging segment in the distressed debt world has been non-performing loans (NPLs).45 The 2007-2009 financial crisis led many banks, notably in Europe, to sell these loans at a discount. The new creditor then engages in active recovery strategies, which could be classified in three categories:

* First, a pressure to recover the backlog of interest and principal repayments.
* Second, a restructuring of the debt to adjust payments to the capacity of the borrower.
* Third, an action towards seizing the assets pledged as collateral, later auctioned for repayment of the principal, interest and damages.

The first two strategies are at the core of active NPL investing (the third being the last-resort solution).

A significant number of LBO fund managers have diversified into distressed debt in the USA (the reasoning being that this is a synergetic way to increase their activities in a down cycle). LBO fund managers have launched distressed debt funds, sometimes with the obvious target of buying cheap the debt of their own portfolio companies (see Davidoff, 2012a for an example of this with Apollo's investments in Realogy). This would allow them to reduce the pressure on debt repayment, salvaging the investments made at the high point of the previous investment cycle. DD represents roughly 32% of the PD fund investment universe, and 6% of the PM investment universe. This does not include turn-around capital and NPL strategies.

#### 4.2.4 Niche Private Debt Strategies

Venture debt is a niche private debt strategy which could be described as the equivalent of mezzanine debt for mature start-ups. Usually, interest is capitalised and funds get their capital, cumulated interest and possibly capital gain upon a liquidity event. Venture debt activity has been limited to a few select markets such as the USA and more recently Europe and Israel. Venture debt funds usually provide convertible debt to late-stage start-ups, often as a complement or an alternative to a new round of financing. According to Preqin, venture debt funds generated an average net IRR of 11.5% between 2007 and 2012. MOIC ranged from 0.83\(\times\) to 1.43\(\times\) and IRR from 1% to 60%. However, none of the funds observed were fully liquidated at the time of the report, so these figures have to be used with caution. Venture debt funds were willing to raise USD 4.4 billion in 2015. This has to be compared with a total of USD 214 billion for private debt funds.46

Footnote 46: Distressed debt funds (as defined in this book) were looking for USD 64 billion, mezzanine/subordinated debt USD 65 billion, direct/senior/unitranche funds USD 77 billion, royalty financing funds USD 2.5 billion, CLO funds USD 2.3 billion and funds of private debt funds USD 1.3 billion (Devine, 2015).

Litigation financing could also be seen as a form of private debt. The borrower can use it to finance pre-trial and trial proceedings (including lawyers' fees). In case of success, the fund gets a share of the financial compensation. In case of failure, the fund loses the investment. In certain instances, litigation financing can be used to finance the post-trial period, functioning as a receivable financing mechanism. The party that prevailed in a legal proceeding gets the financial compensation from the fund in exchange for a discount. The fund then takes over the process of recovering the amount due.

Royalty financing, aviation finance and even trade finance are also other forms of private debt financing which could potentially be seen as an overlap with private real asset debt. Each of these strategies uses either an asset (planes and parts) or claim on future cash-flow streams (royalties or payments) as collateral to provide capital upfront. The fund manager takes over the task of recovering the capital or selling the asset/claim. According to Devine (2015), royalty-financing funds were willing to raise USD 2.5 billion in 2015, representing 1.16% of the total sought by private debt funds.

Other private debt niche strategies, often gathered under the generic expression of'specialty finance', include asset-backed financing. This could overlap with private real asset debt, as tangible or intangible assets are placed in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) structured with equity and debt. The benefit of the lender to the structure is that a specific asset is pledged as collateral for a loan. The owner of the SPV can use the proceeds of the loan for other purposes while avoiding complex negotiations on the loan.

### Private real assets: real estate, infrastructure and natural resources

As illustrated at the beginning of this chapter, private real asset (PRA) funds provide financing at every stage of the development of intangible or tangible real assets (fixed or not). PRA funds offer some attractive features to their fund sponsors, notably recurring cash flows and reduced risks. The return perspectives, however, are lower than in private equity.

There is no entrepreneur at the core of the business in PRA investing, but an asset and potentially a project manager. PRA investing implies much more delimited actions by investors than in PE.

The equivalent of venture capital for PRA is called 'greenfield' investing. This often implies acquiring assets (such as land in the case of real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, timberland and farmland), securing the rights to build, managing the construction and delivering the final asset. This strategy bears significant execution risks, compounded by potential foreign exchange, regulatory and political risks associated with the geographical locations.

The equivalent of growth capital and LBO for PRA is most likely a combination of core, core-plus and value-added investing. Assets are developed, of medium to high quality, and with variable levels of change. Core assets require less debt and transformation, while value-added assets support more debt and require more transformation.

The equivalent of distressed debt and turn-around capital for PRA is opportunistic (or brownfield in private infrastructure), as well as distressed (including non-performing loans) investing.

Private real assets differ substantially from companies financed by private equity and private debt in the sense that they represent a clear and direct access to predictable future cash flows associated with the collateral represented by the asset itself. Therefore, while a hotel management company is a company, the hotel itself is the asset. Sometimes, the two are combined in one entity, and unless the management of the hotel is very lean and passive, it is considered as a company first, with significant assets on its balance sheet.

PRA funds have been growing, with an increased flow of investment opportunities. Multiple factors have contributed to this evolution. First, the trend towards a disentanglement of states in the economy has led to the privatisation of public assets, as well as the emergence of public-private partnerships (to develop new infrastructures, for example). Second, public and private companies have been keen to focus their activities and reduce the size of their balance sheet. Their assets were immobilising financial resources that could be reallocated to compete more effectively. This led to the deconsolidation of assets from balance sheets, placed in SPVs in need of equity providers. Third, as financial institutions have seen their regulatory framework overhauled against the provision of such equity to SPVs, PRAs have seen an opportunity to jump in.

Private real asset funds finance assets through equity (PRA equity funds) or debt (PRA debt funds). Although PRA debt funds are emerging, most PRA funds finance assets through equity. Just as in the PD sector, PRA fund managers can be more or less hands-on depending on the sub-strategies. PRA can be broken down into multiples categories: private real estate, private infrastructure and investment niches.

PRA funds aim to generate a combination of income and capital gains, by acquiring, managing, transforming and selling assets over time. The mix of income and capital gains delivered to investors depends on the type of asset acquired and the transformation operated: the more transformation, the higher the potential capital gains.

#### 4.3.1 Private Real Estate, Infrastructure and Exotic Assets

Private real estate (PRE) funds represent roughly 36% of the PRA market and roughly 10% of the PM universe. These funds acquire real estate such as office, commercial, industrial or residential units, as well as a combination thereof, or more specialised assets such as assisted living facilities or warehouses. Sub-strategies include core/core-plus, value-added and opportunistic, as well as distressed, debt and secondary.47 For the latter three strategies, little information is available. They differ significantly in focus, strategy, character of underlying assets, level of manager involvement, leverage and other factors, all of which result in differing return and risk profiles.

Footnote 47: According to database provider Preqin, debt PRE funds raised USD 27.9 billion in 2017 (25.3% of the total raised by PRE excluding funds of funds), distressed PRE funds USD 2.9 billion (2.6%) and secondary PRE funds USD 0.7 billion (0.6%). As a matter of comparison, PRE funds of funds raised USD 1.2 billion, core PRE funds USD 3.6 billion (3.3%), core-plus PRE funds USD 3.7 billion (3.4%), value-added PRE funds USD 34.9 billion (31.7%) and opportunistic PRE funds USD 36.5 billion (33.1%).

Database provider Preqin estimated that as of June 2017, PRE funds managed USD 811 billion, of which USD 245 billion was 'dry powder'. North America represented 57.9%, Europe 25.9%, Asia 11.5% and the rest of the world 4.7%. Opportunistic PRE funds had USD 98 billion of dry powder, value-added PRE funds USD 61 billion, debt PRE funds USD 49 billion, core PRE funds USD 16 billion, core-plus PRE funds USD 11 billion and distressed PRE funds also USD 11 billion.

While listed real-estate funds provide investors with access to plain vanilla core real estate, PRE funds dedicated to core and core-plus differ. PRE implies a change of assets, leading to a capital gain. Core PRE funds invest at the lower end of the risk spectrum,The \(\chi^{2}\) of the \(\chi^

These two strategies are largely dominated by the USA, although more recently some funds have started to deploy capital in the rest of the world. They provide a combination of yield, as crops and trees are sold, and capital appreciation as the land gains in value. They also provide a certain hedge against inflation. In many respects, they could be compared with private real estate, except that the yield depends on market prices for the commodities they produce and not on regular rents (although for farmland, this could be an option as well).

US timberland funds represent roughly 0.7% of the PRA market and an estimated 0.2% of the PM universe. According to Preqin, farmland and timberland funds represented 5% of unlisted natural resources capital in 2016. According to Cambridge Associates, 24 timberland funds created between 2002 and 2008 and gathering USD 8 billion generated a pooled average of 4.2% and MOIC of 1.36\(\times\). The average time to liquidity is 7.49 years. Over 2004-2008, the PME based on the S&P Global Timber delivered 1.23\(\times\) while timberland funds generated 1.30\(\times\).

Non-renewable commodities funds include private mining funds, for example. There is unfortunately limited information available about this investment strategy.

### Other Interventions in Private markets

As illustrated at the beginning of this chapter, there are multiple interventions that are at the border between private markets and asset management. To establish a border, the easiest path is to observe if there is a direct relationship between the entrepreneur (or project manager in the case of real assets) and the investor. If yes, the strategy might be a good candidate to be included in private markets. If not, then the strategy might not be a clear private markets strategy. Funds of funds are an example: they are an instrument to diversify and manage the exposure of fund investors to private markets. They are at the border of private markets and asset management. The secondary market is another one.

#### 4.4.1 Funds of Funds

As mentioned over the course of the first part of this book, funds of funds have been a privileged tool to help fund investors diversify their private market investments, start a programme easily and at modest levels, and gain exposure and knowledge of the asset class.

The activity of private equity fund of funds activity is relatively recent. The oldest active fund of funds manager (Adams Street Partners) dates back to 1972, but only seven which have survived until now were created in the 1980s. This means that the emergence of the fund of funds industry is correlated with the financial liberalisation of the early 1980s - and the growth of the private equity asset class after.

_The future of funds of funds_

Funds of funds were the great losers of the crisis, notably as they bear their own management fees and carry interest.49 Their number has shrunk as they struggled to attract larger institutions, the latter building their own fund selection and monitoring capacity. Their lack of legitimacy in systematically selecting the top performers was condemning them to be the first victims of the 'war on management fees' that fund investors had re-launched after the financial crisis (Meek, 2012).50 Returns were declining51 and one of the surest ways to preserve them was to bypass the funds of funds managers' fees (which are 0.8-1.0% of assets over 13 years at the moment, plus 5-10% carried interest for funds of funds).

Footnote 50: [http://realdeals.eu.com/article/28986](http://realdeals.eu.com/article/28986), last accessed 16 May 2012.

Footnote 51: 11.6% as of 30 June 2010 (Preegin) and overall 19.2% according to State Street Private Equity Index (30/6/2010), in Jacobius (2011). Toll (2012) states that over 1985 to 2006 and based on 71 funds of funds, the average investment multiple is 1.3, the median multiple is 1.2. The median IRR (55 found in sample) is 5.84% (9.6% for top quartile, 1.5% for bottom quartile).

The responses to these pressures are:

* Consolidation. APG and PGGM sold AlpInvest (a private equity fund of funds manager managing USD 32 billion) to a joint venture between Carlyle and AlpInvest management in 2012.52 Capital Dynamics bought HRJ Capital in 2009. BlackRock bought SwissRe Private Equity Partners in 2012. Gartmore Investment Management merged its private equity fund of funds activity with Hermes Fund Managers, later acquired by Henderson Group (for GBP 78.1 billion). Citigroup sold its private equity fund of funds business to Lexington Partners and Stepstone Group in 2010. Stepstone bought SilverBrook in 2010 and Parish Capital in 2011. Examples of such operations abound. The targets are not lacking, either because they do not have the critical mass, or because they have weathered difficult times, or both (Access Capital Partners was involved in the 'pay-to-play' scandal in the USA). Footnote 52: This in turn helped to fuel the listing of Carlyle, which remains less diversified than its competitors KKR and Blackstone.
* though not broken down between its fund of funds activities and the rest of its divisions).
* Some fund of funds managers offer segregated accounts (tailor-made products) to large institutional investors, where large institutions find a programme adequate for their needs. However, this opens up some difficult questions in terms of _conflict of interests_. Given the fact that the top-quality funds are usually attracting more capital than they really want to raise (over-subscription), investors are scaled down in order to serve at least partially the appetite of a select panel of investors. When a fund of funds manager has a regular programme and has to manage segregated accounts for some other clients, the attribution of the allocation granted by over-subscribed funds becomes tricky. The temptation could exist to serve the programmes where the manager receives the better incentive or derives most of its income, which thus would violate its fiduciary duties to serve the limited partners of the funds it is managing in their best interests.

According to Preqin, funds of funds accounted for USD 16 billion in 2011 (USD 10.7 billion in 2010 out of the USD 225 billion raised in private equity). The number of private equity funds of funds and the capital raised by them had fallen since 2007 (USD 58.1 billion collected by 172 funds) to the lowest level since 2004 (Jacobius, 2011). Quite a few funds of fund managers have not raised capital for some time, which questions their added value. Moreover, they do not benefit from any special treatment (which they could have claimed due to their reduced risk profile) under Basel III, nor under Solvency II.

The retreat of funds of funds would have significant consequences for the private equity market. According to some estimates, they represented 15% of total private equity commitments worldwide (Jacobius, 2011). As stated by David Fann, President and CEO of PCG Asset Management: 'the attrition is particularly unwelcome for certain private equity funds, such as those offering niche investment strategies to raise capital' (quoted in Jacobius, 2011). The proportion seems to have stabilised in Europe to 11-12% according to Invest Europe's figures.

One aspect of the evolution of funds of funds would be a focus on advising fund investors and thus becoming pure gatekeepers, helping them to identify promising emerging managers and set up their investment policy and procedures according to their needs.53 Another could be to create products with a specific focus:54 certain emerging markets (Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, African countries, Latin American countries); certain sectors (clean technologies, nanotechnologies, new materials); or strategies (small LBOs, distressed debt in Europe) which are difficult to assess (Mariathasan & Steward, 2011).

Footnote 53: Investors not only require the services of a fund of funds – or a manager of managers, if you will – but they [also] want to be trained. A part of what we do is to train investors to evolve into being a direct investor...’, Kevin Albert, Global Head of Business Development at Pantheon, cited in Power (2012).

Footnote 54: According to Albert, that means the old “one size fits all” approach is no longer sufficient’ (Power, 2012).

A third vector of evolution for funds of funds lies in their untapped capacity to create products which can either enhance the performance (through financial leverage, as applied by Adrian in certain fund of funds programmes), reduce the illiquidity period (either by structuring products, as Capital Dynamics did or by offering 'windows' of exit to fund investors), or provide a product with more regular cash flows (using a mix of debt and equity investments).

The real renewal of the fund of funds activity came with co-investments. As many fund investors are not equipped with the adequate resources to co-invest, they in effect delegate to fund of funds managers the task to evaluate, select and monitor co-investments. As a result, some managers have launched dedicated co-investments funds, while others have blended them into their funds of funds programmes, along with secondary investments (see next section). By co-investing, fund of funds managers offer a specific service to fund investors while reducing the overall load of their fees. Fund investors pay lower management fees and carried interest to managers on the funds of funds activity, which is comparatively more expensive than investing directly in funds. However, they pay reduced co-investment fees, which are less expensive than investing directly in funds. As a result, the blended product can deliver an attractive net performance for a low level of risk.

#### The Secondary Market

As the private equity market was maturing slowly, a private equity secondary market emerged. The difference with listed markets is that the primary market in private equity represents most of the flows, whereas it is secondary transactions which compose most of the volume on the stock exchange. The secondary market is active at different levels:

* fund managers usually take a stake in a private equity operation for a specific purpose. In various cases, the company cannot be listed or sold to a strategic investor (trade sale). In that case, other fund managers can take over the company in order to develop it further, thus making a secondary investment such as, for example, a secondary LBO.
* some fund investors, owing to cash requirements or the need to rebalance their portfolio, may need to sell their stakes in certain private equity funds before the term of these funds. They therefore sell these stakes to secondary buyers, who benefit not only from a shorter fund life span and a higher level of maturity of the portfolio company, but also a reduced expectation in terms of returns. These sales can be operated at a premium or a discount on the NAV of the fund, depending on the situation of the portfolio, the quality of the fund manager and the market situation, as well as the timeframe of the operation.
* some funds sometimes reach their term without having sold all of their assets. In that case, they put their remaining assets up for sale. Usually, this sale is operated at a discount and can be operated on the full portfolio or on a single portfolio company.

With the advent of the secondary market, a complete ecosystem is emerging. This is a rather recent market, which has been developing fast, essentially in the fund stake segment. _Liquidity being one of the key problems in finance,_ the more the secondary market develops, the more private equity will mature and become an autonomous market with regard to other asset classes. Some fund investors are repeat sellers, hence using the secondary market for active fund portfolio management (Figure 4.54).

One of the factors which could thus emerge is that the value of portfolio companies could refer less and less to the listed market. As transactions operate on a specific secondary market, and become increasingly numerous, a specific pricing reference could emerge - as is the case for real estate, for example. The correlation with the stock exchange would vary with the maturity of the company and the holding period. This prospect would contribute to the reduction of the influence of the stock exchange as the main and quasi-unique reference for the pricing of assets.

According to the analysis of Bills (2010), the secondary market could be supported by a long-term trend, despite the fact that the crisis did not bring the wave of opportunities that secondary specialists were expecting. However, he quotes Charles Stetson (fund manager and co-founder of the secondary firm PEI Funds), saying that 'institutional investors, especially the pension funds of the world, are at a historic crossroads. In the United States, for instance, the baby boom generation - the largest population cohort in the nation's history - is beginning to retire, and other advanced economies, such as Japan's, are even further down that road. No longer will pension funds be raking in contributions from those workers; instead they will have to pay them out toretirees. This may dampen their enthusiasm for making decade-long commitments to illiquid investments with lumpy payout records [...]. And when the selling starts in secondaries, it is likely to trigger a rush for the exits, clobbering the values of asset sales and exacerbating the crisis.'

As private equity potentially offers a fully integrated financing chain, it could soon bypass the stock exchange. In certain countries or sectors, industrial companies are teaming up with private equity investors so as to benefit from their expertise. This was the case for mobile operators in Eastern and Central Europe, for example.

The professionalisation of private equity, thanks notably to the emergence of vendor due diligence, an increasing level of intermediation in the private equity operations, the specialisation of fund managers in certain private equity operations (regardless of their diversification out of private equity), the development of mezzanine and high-yield bonds, and the wider acceptance of private equity as a quasi-mainstream asset class will give credibility to a specific pricing reference from private equity.

This can only happen if these prices are communicated and accessible to the professionals who are not involved in the transactions. That remains to be seen and, so far, secondary operations, notably for distressed sales of fund stakes or portfolios/single assets, remain largely out of public sight. The future of private equity hence lies in a higher, tightly knit intermediation fed by a large ecosystem of specialised boutiques, not in disintermediation.

#### Collateralised Debt Obligations

With the growing size of LBOs, banks started not only to syndicate the loans, but eventually to package and sell them on the financial markets. Collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) or collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) are syndicated repackaged loans and

Figure 4.54: Repeat sellers of private equity fund stakes on the secondary market

debts combining features of funds of funds and secondaries. Hedge funds have been buying into the debt of large and very large buy-outs through these CDOs and CLOs, for many reasons. Not only do these debts offer a better return than some other assets, with lower risk, but they are also better able to handle cases of default. At a certain stage, the demand for high-yield bonds (e.g., non-rated debt) was so high that its cost fell close to investment-grade debt, despite the degradation of the financial health of companies. Hedge funds would have renegotiated tougher terms with LBO fund managers, but would not be afraid of the prospect of becoming owners of businesses.

LBO fund managers have sensed this change in the balance of power and to avoid a confrontation with hedge fund activists, they asked their lenders to include clauses in the contracts to prevent the selling of some debt tranches to hedge funds (see _The Economist_, 2012b for an illustration, in Australia, of the seizing of CVC's Nine).

These products were then rated and sold to institutional investors. When some of the debt packages defaulted (namely subprime mortgages in the USA), the risk-return profile of CDOs and CLOs tanked. The market was no longer liquid, as institutional investors flew from these packaged products. Large and mega LBOs have been virtually blocked for a while, as their debts were part of these CDOs and CLOs. One of the reasons is that financial leverage is now increasingly restricted, as banks had to rebuild their capital basis and review the risks associated with the credits they granted. New regulations might also force them to keep a higher proportion of capital in order to lend to businesses.

Prior to the crisis, the American National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) declared in 2006 that hybrid debts (ranking behind other debts as to priority of payment but benefitting from conversion options) must be accounted for as equity investments. Just as banks must keep a given amount in their balance sheets for every transaction that they make, insurers would have to save more capital in their balance sheets to cover the risk entailed by these instruments. The cover rate, that is the percentage of capital demanded for each investment, depends on the estimated risk of these investments. The greater the risk, the higher the cover rate will be, in order to offset possible problems arising from a given investment.

The NAIC decision has set an early example. Subordinated debts will be more expensive for insurers and therefore less attractive in relative terms. This means that return expectations for subordinated debts will probably be higher and therefore that the cost for borrowers (private equity funds) will increase. As a result, either mezzanine funds will demand higher returns through conversion rights, or the interest rates of mezzanine debt will rise. The balance of private equity deals will probably change because of this, once the effects of the crisis have been absorbed.

CDOs and CLOs are the second generation of the high-yield bonds (or 'junk bonds') which were _en vogue_ in the 1980s to finance LBOs. The high-yield bond crashed along with the demise of the bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, which developed and was ruling more or less alone this market. Based on this experience, the professionals from Drexel went into other banks (and notably Lehman Brothers, which disappeared in 2008) to create these structured products. The need for high-yield debts, and their successors, by LBO operations, as well as investors (for the yields that they provide) means that this market will not disappear (Bullock, 2011). The products have re-emerged (_Financial Times_, 2012a,b) rather strongly.

The success of CLOs is related to their very low level of losses: only 1.9% over the period 2007-2011 according to Fitch (see Figure 4.55). The heaviest losses came from market prices and not defaults from underlying loans.

To re-emerge, CLOs and CDOs had to comply with very high capital requirements from banks and insurance groups. That has changed the equilibrium of the products. Transparency has improved, renewing the trust in these products. In particular, a higher financial commitment is required from product makers (banks had to increase their share of the products) and the rating agencies (which had to take into account the jurisprudence and expectations from regulators and clients).

#### Exotic Assets

Some assets do not belong to the private equity asset class as they do not fit with the definition outlined in the Introduction and are thus 'alternative alternatives' (Blessing, 2011). What about art and wine? Even though some funds have been launched in those areas, the same criteria apply: follow the entrepreneur. A fund dedicated to invest in fine art, even though structured as a private equity fund, does not belong to this area. There is no entrepreneurial endeavour attached to this activity, as well as no separation between the investor and the actor of the market. Here again, the art industry fund differentiates itself in the sense that it focuses on companies belonging exclusively to the fine art value chain, with entrepreneurs at the helm.

### Conclusion

Private markets could be described as a financial ecosystem living in symbiosis with the listed markets. While private markets are able to finance a company at any stage of its development, it is however not a must-have for every company or asset.

Figure 4.55: Losses on structured finance deals in Europe and the USA (2007–2011)

#### 4.5.1 Private Markets are a Financing Solution Designed for a Specific Need

Private markets are not necessary for any venture launched, developed or restructured. Most of the companies being created do not need the help of a venture capital fund. Professional capital infusions are made to support ambitious corporate projects which present (measurable) risks and returns, have specific needs and could not be financed otherwise.

#### 4.5.2 Venture and Growth Capital

Thus, many start-ups financed during the venture capital boom of 1997-2000 did not really need a professional capital infusion, as was proven by the unusual rate of failures after this time and the number of companies remaining in fund portfolios. Private equity is useful when it is a matter of financing heavy investment; to save time in the development of a given product or service; to answer an urgent need from the market which is not addressed by incumbent players; or to capitalise on the successful proof of concept of a product or service.

#### 4.5.3 Leveraged Buy-out

In the same respect, not all companies which are going through a transition of ownership need an LBO. This is quite obvious in the case of succession or retirement of an owner-manager. To be a target for this transition, the company must support the heavy burden of acquisition debt. LBO fulfils a need when there is no other possibility offered to the future buyer, where it does not have the equity or the expertise to do so. On many occasions, it is possible to think about a gradual payment of the acquisition, notably because the sale is usually accompanied by a disengagement of the current owner-manager. It is also possible to structure a sponsorless LBO transaction (i.e., without any involvement of an LBO fund).

Are there limits to the appetite of private equity investors? Is it a specific asset class? Will private equity, reputed to be 'hands on', evolve towards 'hands off', traditional investing in listed companies? To answer these questions, we will examine the dynamics of private equity, and notably the central place of the relationship between the entrepreneur and the investor in private equity (Chapter 5).

_Private equity and employment_

Though venture and growth capital are necessarily net creators of employment, LBO is sometimes accused of destroying employment (Applebaum & Batt, 2014). If the subject is still regularly debated,55 a VP Bank analysis shows that this is not the case. According to Figure 4.56, switching the control from a family-owned to an institutionally owned company (through an LBO) is actually creating employment. The company has to create employment to be ready to be sold as an autonomous and self-reliant entityto the next owner (an LBO fund is only a transitional owner). Secondary LBOs also create value, far from being pure financial investments and using only financial leverages. The reason is that as LBO funds are buying a company, they need to create value to sell it at a _bigher price_ to the next owner (unless one assumes that the next buyers are systematically over-paying to buy the portfolio companies of LBO funds, which is difficult to justify).

Interestingly, delisting does not translate into a reduction in jobs, but an increase in recruitment. The reasons for this increase could be variable, but it is probably related to the need to give a certain dynamism into the company which was delisted to accomplish a particular project (acquisition, launch of new product, internationalisation, etc.). The progression is more modest in the case of a spin-off, but still significant. This is due to the fact that the newly independent company has to recruit to support functions which were formerly shared with the parent company.

The case of turn-around capital could give rise to criticism. The regression of employment is potentially a big concern for this strategy and its impact on a given economy. However, there should be no concern, as the other alternative is more often than not the pure and simple liquidation of the company with full loss of jobs, as illustrated by the failed turn-around of Hostess Brands (Primack, 2012b),56 which produces Twinkies and Wonder Bread (those brands will survive; Cherney, 2012).57 The intervention of turn-around investors is helpful in restructuring the company, hence shedding some jobs in the process, but also preserving others - and later recruiting again, once the company has found its new path to growth. The net job situation might be negative, but this scenario is undoubtedly better than a full loss of jobs.

Footnote 56: [http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/16/dont-worry-twinkies-will-survive/](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/16/dont-worry-twinkies-will-survive/).

Footnote 57: [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-06/how-much-is-a-twinkie-worth](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-06/how-much-is-a-twinkie-worth).

Figure 4.56: Evolution of the net job situation according to the type of private equity operation undertaken

These figures have to be compared with the case of an acquisition by a strategic investor, as it is likely that the progression of recruitment would be more limited (notably due to the synergies between the parent and the subsidiary).

_Understanding the market dynamics (and statistics)_

As for the dynamic of the private equity market, France offers an interesting perspective (see Table 8). It is the second European private equity market in size, after the UK (which has de facto become the platform for pan-European investors and a net exporter of capital until now, although this could change as the UK leaves the EU). Its market is quite well structured and offers a clear picture of the dynamics of the private equity sector.

Table 8 shows the difference between funds raised, which will be invested over the 5 years following the raising of the fund; the amounts invested, illustrating the investments made in a given year; and the divestments which are the exits from investments made over the course of the years preceding the divestment. These three figures are related: a constant fall in fundraising dries up the financing of future years. On the contrary, low divestment levels on a recurring basis are in fact increasing the size of portfolios and do not return to investors to participate in the next private equity cycle.

As shown in Table 8, venture capital gathers each year approximately EUR 400-800 million, although 2017 and 2018 have been exceptional. These high figures echo those of the previous venture capital boom at the end of the 1990s. Growth capital shows a doubling of its volume over a period of 10 years. This is the result of strong public support for an investment strategy that is supportive of economic growth and employment. As the amounts started from a low level and seemed to catch up with the economic potential (supposedly higher than venture capital, as start-ups require on average less capital than growing established companies), this looks like a sustainable path of growth. The LBO sector is much more volatile, as it depends mostly on the opportunities and the availability of affordable debt for acquisition. As for the LBO figures in Table 8, they are accumulating the amounts invested in equity (i.e., they exclude debt).

It is thus important to consider private equity as a flow and not as an inventory of capital. If the total size of funds being raised is inferior to the total amount invested each

_The evolution of private markets: neo merchant banking_

The diversification of certain LBO fund managers can appear unusual. After all, funds have been focusing increasingly on specific private equity operations, as described earlier. The reason for moving away from the generalist fund model, which combined venture capital, growth and LBO investments in one product, was that fund managers did not have the relevant expertise to target these different operations properly.

Why are large buy-out operators diversifying into distressed debt, real estate, hedge funds, mergers and acquisitions, advisory and other sectors? One of the obvious answers is that investment banking skills and mega/large buy-out investment skills are basically the same. The profile and experience of the professionals in these firms confirm it. As big buy-out players were targeting larger and more complex businesses, they started to develop their own pool of in-house competence. They thus began to offer this competence on the market.

Another reason is that behind the scenes, fund managers have evolved considerably. From the little group of investment professionals supported by a chief financial officer and back-office staff, these companies have grown increasingly to integrate legal capabilities, a secretary general to coordinate the multiple funds and manage the fund manager structures, investor relations capabilities and other middle- and back-office functions. The most advanced ones provide services to their portfolio companies, ranging from recruitment and purchasing to operational advice.

These developments were driven by the increasing need for information from fund investors in terms of reporting and due diligence documentation. Fund managers also had to integrate some risk management functions into their practices, either under legal pressure or under pressure from their investors. France, for example, has ruled that every fund manager is comprised of a certain number of professionals, including one in charge of deontology, and disposes of a certain amount of capital as proof of financial solidity for the investors. Investors have increasingly requested detailed quarterly and annual reports in order to be able to evaluate the work of fund managers and the situation of the portfolio for themselves. This has subsequently generated an increased need for middle- and back-office professionals, which in return has necessitated a higher level of income.

The advent of the AIFMD in Europe and the FATCA in the USA brought significant changes. Fund managers have rightfully argued that multiple regulations (Basel III, Solvency II, AIFMD, Volcker rule, Dodd-Frank Act) have dried up some of the historical sources of private equity financing, and hence of private companies. The consequences of the AIFMD or the Dodd-Frank Act are not yet fully known, but they have resulted in a durable slowdown of the emergence of new fund managers and new strategies due to costs (see Table 9); and the temptation to get around the regulation either through innovation, or by exploiting loopholes. The latter might remind us of what happened in the past with junk bonds and securitisation: the misuse of interesting innovation to circumvent legislative excess, which led to another crisis.

As a consequence, the minimum threshold that has to be reached in order to create a fund management company and be able to manage third-party funds has increased. This could reduce the number of emerging managers arriving each year on the market, and thus the ability to finance under-served areas of the private equity sector. This can only provide an undue advantage to established teams which are not performing, but which were launched long ago. They can stay on the market simply because fund investors cannot fully allocate their capital to the asset class, and also because most of them do not have the skills to evaluate emerging managers.

## Chapter The Process of Investment

_A Matter of Trust and Mutual Interest_

In the past decade, the process of Investment opportunities has been a major topic in the past decade. The process of Investment opportunities has been a major topic in the past decade.

assessed and that nothing has been left out. Some adjustments can be made, as these audits deliver their results, and the transaction can finally be done (see Section 5.6).

This process (see Figure 5.1) is found mainly in the LBO sector, as venture and growth capital investments are rather less technical in terms of financial engineering (Kedrosky & Stangler, 2011). However, the preliminary analysis and valuation steps can take more time in venture capital, as the technological choices and financial projections are more difficult to assess. At the other end of the spectrum, legal and social impacts have more weight in a company turn-around than in the case of a venture capital or an LBO investment. It is hence necessary to adapt the following developments to the operation's framework.

Private debt and private real asset strategies follow a similar process with some tweaks. In the case of direct lending, the negotiation is not on the valuation of the company and governance rights, but on the terms of the loan and its monitoring. As for distressed debt investing, the process is driven by bankruptcy laws. Though the potential buyer of the debt of the bankrupt company ultimately executes similar work as in other private equity and private debt strategies, the operational process and the order of the different steps are conditioned by legal proceedings. As for private real assets, the assessment is often driven more by the operational assessment of the asset by independent experts, and less by the establishment of a trust relationship with the management. Nevertheless, the following steps are in general a good description of the process of investing in private markets.

### 5.1 **Step 1: preliminary analysis**

The success of an investor is largely conditioned by his aptitude to find the right investment opportunities. The preliminary analysis aims to create a _trust relationship_ between the management team of the company and the investment team of the fund manager. The nature of the information communicated at this stage varies a lot. The level of information made public varies a lot depending on the jurisdictions in which the company is registered. Moreover, some management teams will be more protective of the information than others. For the investment team, this entails a certain number of work meetings, presentations, information exchanges and analyses of the company situation. Depending on the nature of the opportunity, one or more company visits can be organised.

Figure 5.1: Steps from first contact to the conclusion of a private equity investment

Investment teams are expected to follow deontology (or at least compliance) guidelines which are set by the professional associations to which they usually belong. In particular, confidentiality plays a significant role early on. A non-disclosure agreement can be signed early, as some sensitive information might be required by the investment team. Any information that is gathered by the investment team is supposed to be used only to support the analysis of investment opportunities.

These opportunities are usually referred by a network that the investor has built patiently, and which is composed not only of former entrepreneurs that he has already backed, but also other investors, accountants, lawyers, etc. These contacts help the fund manager source deals through his proprietary network. Depending on the source of the investment opportunity, the process can be accelerated or can take more time.

An alternative source of investment opportunities can be found through auctions organised by the sellers of companies (in the case of LBO) or assets (private real assets).2 In that case, the seller mandates an intermediary, such as a corporate finance boutique or an investment bank, to run a competitive process. The potential buyers are contacted by this intermediary with a pre-packaged set of information (vendor due diligence) which is sent after the signature of a non-disclosure agreement (see above).

Footnote 2: As for distressed debt, the competitive process is effectively run by the bankruptcy court.

In the case of venture and growth capital, the competitive process is organised by the management of the company. Potential investors compete with each other on the terms but also on the nature of their value creation. The management of the company represents the existing investors and negotiates in their name with the prospective investors.

Overall, the investment team essentially checks the fundamentals of the investment opportunity. This is a filtering process, most of the investment opportunities being rejected and a few qualifying for further analysis. At this stage of the investment process, the costs for the fund are limited or negligible. Once the investment opportunity is qualified, significant resources will be consumed in a detailed analysis. For that reason, the filter is strict and systematic. Any opportunity which goes beyond this stage and does not lead to an actual investment will generate costs (aborted deal costs), which have to be recouped from the performance of other investments. The incentive for the fund manager is to avoid such scenarios as much as possible.

A first memorandum will be drafted by the investment team. This memorandum is the result of the evaluation of the investment team, and helps the different members of the fund managers to determine whether or not it makes sense to pursue the analysis further.

### 27 Step 2: Initial Valuation

The valuation process leads the team to determine a bracket of prices, with a lower and a higher bound for the acquisition of the company. This bracket is determined by investors when assessing the intrinsic value of the company, often by comparing it with other companies, notably those which are listed and disclose significant information. The valuation process is the application of a combination of methods defined by the IPEV (see Chapter 4). One is using the listed comparables and most recent transactions in the sector thanks to an investment multiple analysis. This method uses the profit and loss statement and projections of the company. This is probably the method which is the most used in the private equity sector. Corporate finance manuals provide the basics, and one of the most comprehensive resources3 is provided by Aswath Damodaran. In particular, this author provides up-to-date multiples per sector of activity, as well as indications for adjustments depending on the country considered and other factors.

Footnote 3: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html).

Another method is to make projections of the company's cash flows and assess the value of the firm as the sum of its future cash flows (discounted cash flows). This method is based on the cash-flow statement and projections of a company. Using it determines the cash flows for the upcoming years, the discount rate and a realistic and satisfying growth rate for the company. This projection is thus somewhat difficult to model, as the discount rate and the infinite growth rate necessary to compute the formula have to be extracted from somewhere. If the analyses of listed comparables can be used again, the ratios have to be adjusted and this leaves room for a lot of interpretation - and potential haggling with the seller. However, this method provides a value _in fine_, which can be compared to the entry price. It can also help to model scenarios where the investment does not follow the expected path, and to design pre-emptive actions and be prepared for unfavourable scenarios.

A third approach consists of valuing the assets of the firm and determining the costs of their replacement. This approach uses the balance sheet of the company. It helps the investor to identify hidden sources of value (e.g., real estate which is fully amortised but has significant market value) or costs (e.g., a machine which is obsolete and not fully amortised and has to be replaced by a better one).

Valuing loss-making businesses such as start-ups and bankrupt companies can be difficult. In the first case, the company has no real operational performance, and projections are difficult to confirm. Transparency is paramount. Investors want to carefully assess the management's capacity to deliver, but also its knowledge of the market. Reference checking is crucial and helps to understand how the management will deliver. It still does not provide support for a valuation. Most investors will combine two approaches. First, they will look at the most probable exit scenario in 5 to 7 years. They will value the business at that date thanks to the multiple method described above, and apply a series of discounts to take into account the uncertainties and the time discount. This becomes the valuation at time of exit. They compare this valuation with the one requested by the current investors, and will take into account the future need for capital of the company (hence diluting their potential stake in the firm). The difference between the current expected valuation by the existing investors and the prospective valuation at exit (fully diluted) is the performance of the investor. This should match (at worst) or exceed the expected multiple of investment promised to fund investors.

The second approach, when assessing very early-stage start-ups, is to assign an arbitrary valuation to the firm providing the new investors with a significant stake (30% or above) and focus on governance rights to reduce the risks. The shareholders' agreement, as well as the rights embedded in the preferred shares issued by the start-up, become more important. Among the most important are the liquidation rights, which define the timing and the priority of exit of shareholders and minimal guaranteed returns to specific categories of shareholders. Other rights might include a non-dilution clause, preventing current shareholders seeing their stake diluted by the emission of new shares in future rounds of financing, thus deflecting the burden on common shareholders.

These are fairly fragile risk reduction mechanisms, as the shareholders' agreement is only valid between current investors. Any new investor, in an upcoming financing round, might want to amend this document. Either current investors refuse, and will therefore have to support the start-up alone (or with the support of another investor yet to be found), or they will have to accept the new terms. The careful crafting of the shareholders' agreement, reflecting the balance of power at the investment date, will survive if the start-up is highly desirable by future prospective investors and therefore achieves or outperforms its target until the next fundraising stage.

In the case of bankrupt businesses, accumulated losses represent an asset which has to be valued as they are de facto a tax shield for future profits until these losses are fully compensated. The valuation requires extra steps to quantify the capital need of the business, the costs of restructuring, the time required for its recovery and ultimately its return to profits.

This initial bracket of valuations is useful to assess if, after the filtering (see previous section), the expectations of the investor and the seller are close enough. If the gap between these expectations is too large, it might be difficult to reconcile them through negotiations. This bracket of valuations will also help the intermediary running an auction to decide who will be admitted in a restricted auction, or to give exclusivity to the leading contender for a specific period of time. During this exclusivity, the buyer and the seller hold talks directly and the other contenders are excluded.

The choice of the potential buyer is not only a matter of choosing the highest bid. The reputation matters too, when it comes to the ability to execute a professional due diligence on time, to execute the transaction (in particular when structuring debt is involved) and ultimately to execute a successful deal. The seller might be wary of selling a company or an asset and later seeing its reputation damaged from a botched acquisition. Beyond the reputation, the deal terms are also of importance, notably when it comes to the governance and the terms of the transaction (payment in multiple installments, combination of cash and shares, or other variations).

This first rough approach of valuations with brackets helps the potential buyer to determine what would be its profit at exit. In fact, the buyer will often recompute the projections of the firm according to specific scenarios. The buyer plans to execute a specific plan to create value in the firm. Assuming that this plan is successful, the value of the firm will increase. The buyer will value the firm at exit date and compare the current valuation at entry and the potential valuation at exit. The difference is the performance. Depending on the level of uncertainty, and therefore of risk, the performance might be rewarding or not. The younger the company, the more elements of uncertainty there are, and the more complex is the valuation exercise. At times, the buyer will assign probabilities to the multiple outcomes issuing from the scenarios. The result of this tree of options will help to determine the potential valuation.

The exit (or liquidity) scenario is crucial. Most of the successful exits are trade sales, then, in second place, come the sales to other investors and the smallest proportion is initial public offerings (see Chapter 4). Exit at a loss or liquidation are also a possibility that the potential buyer has to anticipate: this is the worst-case scenario analysis. It can the event.

They can include a first right of refusal, if a shareholder wishes to sell his participation before the others. He must then offer his stake to the other investors and offer them this stake before going to market. The shareholders' agreement can also include liquidity conditions, which set the exit rules for the investors. The agreement can also contain a preferred right of liquidity, as a guarantee of having a priority return until the company reaches a certain valuation upon exit.

The end of the negotiation is triggered by multiple factors. Legally, offer and acceptance form a contract. However, this can be subject to further investigation, and subsequently to complementary audits (see below). In the case of restricted auctions without exclusivity, there can be a beauty contest between funds (or consortia of funds) willing to buy a stake in the company or acquire it.

Existing owners are free to accept or decline the offers to the best of their interests. As mentioned above, it is not necessarily the highest bid which will be accepted, as the quality of the investment team and what it can bring to the company are also highly regarded. The financial plan of the company and its success can depend on factors which are difficult to quantify. In that case, price adjustment and earn-out clauses are included in the sale agreement. These clauses are indexed on the performance of the company and the achievements that the shareholders and the management hope to realise after the actual transaction. Acquiring an existing company is usually associated with a certain number of precise risks related to the past management of the company. The acquiring fund can then request warranties and representations which will be waived (and compensated by the former owner) as the risks materialise, or not. Therefore, the transaction can happen while some of the characteristics, whether on the upside (with an earn-out for example) or the downside (with warranties), are still open.

The due diligence represents a significant effort. The purpose is not only to check the current status of the company or the asset, but also to design a plan so that it gains in value after the acquisition. By getting an intimate knowledge of the company or asset for sale, the buyer can indeed start to design an action plan even before finalising the transaction, define precisely the hypothesis, detail the immediate measures to implement (the 'first 100-days plan'), design monitoring indicators and prepare scenarios to run with the management. The reason for this early action is that the fund manager's performance uses some metrics which are time-sensitive, such as the IRR. Any delay in the launch and execution of the plan will postpone the advent of an exit, and therefore reduce the IRR. It is in the interests of the fund manager to plan ahead, and in particular to pre-plan answers to any deviation from the initial plan.

### Step 4: Structuring

Depending on the nature of the operation, the financial structure can be more or less complex. A venture capital investment, taking a minority share in a start-up, can appear to be simple, but it necessarily entails a certain formal legal wording and probably the set-up of incentive tools (such as stock options) for the company staff. Given the high risks involved in the development of start-ups, the governance rights provided to investors will probably be comprehensive and detailed in the shareholders' agreement. Standard clauses include tag-along and drag-along rights to solve the question of joint exits from an investment; as well as veto rights on specific management decisions such as C-level recruitments, spending programmes and salary increases; or even exit clauses defining a contractual timeframe for an exit.

Whatever the type of structuring, it is in the best interests of investors that the staff reaches, and eventually goes beyond, the assigned targets of the company. Fund managers usually have a stock option plan. This lever can be very effective if the management team has a very small stake in the company. It is in the best interests of the investor to give a share of the profit to increase the likelihood of meeting the targets. It also aligns interests, as the management finds greater advantage in the sale of the company.

A stock option plan can also be set up to refund investors if the management fails to achieve its targets. In the case of a venture investment, the management is usually the founders who have a significant share of the start-up. If the start-up under-performs against the plan, the investors over-paid their shares and therefore can require to get new shares (hence diluting the founders) as compensation.

The structuring should also plan for the organisation of powers and communication between the investors and the managers. The more the fund managers are involved financially in the company, the more investors will control and monitor the activities of the management team. In the case of a majority LBO, it is not unusual for fund managers to have the majority of the seats on the Board. Venture capital fund managers generally require a monthly report to help them react more quickly to any discrepancy in the business plan, Board seats and significant shareholders' rights.

The covenants of the LBO debt are financial and non-financial. The volume of debt and the calculation of interest depend on the targets assigned to the company (EBITDA level, gearing, etc.). Moreover, other non-financial targets, such as monthly client acquisition, have an influence on the understanding of the operations and an impact on the eventual renegotiations with the banks.

In general, structuring is a reflection of the negotiations and targets the optimal exit of investments. Investors have therefore often identified the potential buyers for their portfolio companies at entry, in order to prepare and facilitate their investment exit. An LBO holding which will make complementary acquisitions in order to create a group (leveraged build-up) will integrate corporate governance and clauses which will assist in these acquisitions and govern the future entity.

Exit clauses for shareholders are also common, whatever the type of investment (venture capital, LBO, etc.). Funds taking minority stakes are especially attentive to the conditions under which they can sell their ownership. The shareholders' agreement can include a forced sale clause (drag along) according to financial, timing or other criteria, at the initiative of investment funds. This will guarantee the fund an effective exit path which the management of the company cannot refuse to comply with - even if it could buy out the fund at a determined price. In Central Europe, a certain number of deals, bringing together financial investors and strategic investors (in mobile telephony, for example), have used this kind of structuring. Investment funds took over a local company on behalf of an international group, restructured it and then sold it to this international group at a pre-defined price indexed on the performance of the local company.

### Step 5: Complementary Due Diligence

Complementary due diligence will assist in answering any remaining questions, in order to proceed to the conclusion of an effective transaction. In general, this due diligence is comprised of financial, environmental, social, tax and other audits. It is thus found mainly in growth capital, LBO and turn-around investments. Some of these audits require a certain amount of time, especially when the company has subsidiaries abroad, or large inventories to check.

Venture capital funds can also require complementary audits, notably in technology, regulation or contractual matters. Patenting innovation can take a certain time. The value of a company can ultimately depend greatly on the success of this process. However, it is important not to over-estimate the value of patents as such. Intrisically and isolated, they are not worth a lot. They are valuable as an array of claims on a stream of future cash flows. Investors will probably require some legal intellectual property expertise as well as industrial audits, in order to check the validity and originality of the concept to be covered by the patent request. The validity and the forced application of a contract with a major client can also be crucial for the evaluation of a young company. It is not uncommon for legal auditors to evaluate contracts, or for some further formalisation to be done before the investment.

### Step 6: Transaction

The transaction is a process which involves the production of legal documents, such as a shareholders' agreement or an interim financial audit. In the case of an LBO, warranties and representations may be requested from the seller. The transaction is the result of a balance of powers and of a delicate equilibrium. It is not unusual that a transaction is cancelled because a new event with significant material consequences has happened prior to the signature.

An aborted transaction represents a significant cost for an investment fund. The due diligence represents expertise and other costs which cannot be compensated or refunded in the case of a disagreement over the transaction. In that respect, the multiplication of auctions in LBO offerings implies not only expertise in order to make an informed offer, but also a higher number of aborted transactions. Investors like to negotiate an exclusivity clause early enough so as to have a better chance of securing the deal.

Paradoxically, the failure of a transaction is not necessarily connected to the seller or the management of the company. Potential buyers can push the auctions higher, and eventually the pricing may become so aggressive that structuring is impossible to achieve. Banks and mezzanine investment funds may conclude that the deal is too risky and decide that they cannot participate in the operation. The auction has then failed and becomes a broken auction. The seller has to restart the sales process, with additional delays and the reputational damage associated with this broken auction.

A number of deals are negotiated and executed on the basis of a broken auction. This has an obvious impact on the seller, as the situation is less favourable. The seller not only has to decide which offer is the best financially, but must also name a reliable acquirer, who offers a genuine development plan and strategic perspective, and who is able to convince the banks to lend for the LBO.

Moreover, the creation of acquisition consortia is an answer to the auction and the competition of funds organised by the seller. The fund managers team up to make offers, each contributing financially and bringing their own expertise. This explains why very large buy-out deals are debated between three to four consortia of LBO funds. The leader of each consortium represents its group of auctioneers and manages the due diligence, the costs of which will be shared between the members of the consortium.

This practice is less common in venture or growth capital. Here, the current investors invite new investors to invest alongside them. This system, termed a 'cluster of investors', aims to create a group of shareholders which brings the assets that it needs in order to reach the next stage of development for the company. Some fund managers bring know-how in terms of commercial development, a network of partners, support for the internationalisation of the company, manager recruitment capacity or know-how in terms of initial public offering or trade sale.

### 7 Step 7: Monitoring and Ebit

Investment monitoring and exit are steps in the investment process in the sense that the exit conditions the performance. Negotiating an attractive price during an investment is an important step, but managing development and exiting at the most opportune time are as important as investment.

The most promising companies and assets are approached regularly by strategic acquirers or banks offering attractive exit paths. Anticipating the evolution of financial markets, valuation levels and industrial cycles is especially difficult. Some investment teams have recruited specialists to manage such monitoring, as well as the establishment of professional reporting on their portfolio companies. They have also recruited specialists in mergers and acquisitions or stock exchange listings, in order to 'industrialise' their divestment processes. In that respect, fund managers are increasingly being supported by consultants. The prediction of economic cycles and the management of investment timing so as to optimise the sale price are as much a matter of experience as self-control.

More generally, investment teams have the resources to cover not only most of the elements in the investment process, but also communication, advisory and strategic analysis. Slowly, they are becoming integrated and multi-functional investors. Some teams have even gone beyond this and established advisory practices which are active as independent advisors on the financial market. This is the case with The Blackstone Group, in the USA, which has evolved into an 'asset management house'. The status of this group, as well as the size of assets under its management, has transformed it into a merchant or an investment bank. The source of profits for the investment bank Goldman Sachs, for example, is mostly in hedge funds and private equity.

These two groups can go into partnership for a given operation (Blackstone providing the equity and Goldman Sachs the debt); or they can be clients and providers in another (Blackstone selling a company and Goldman Sachs listing it) and competitors in a third (Blackstone competing with Goldman Sachs for the acquisition of a business). The intricacy of these relationships can of course raise some concerns as to ethics and good business practice (see Chapter 6).

These developments may herald major changes, which are described in Chapters 6 and 7 and in the General Conclusion (Chapter 8).

### 8 Conclusion

Factors in the success of private equity funds are:

* Companies must have a strong potential for development, either nationally or internationally, or have a position with strong barriers to entry.
* Investments must be made at reasonable valuations and (if applicable) with solid and viable financial leverage.
* Managers of the company must be able to cope with the additional burden of reporting and managing the expectations of professional investors, who plan to exit at a given stage from company ownership.
* There must be a specific target for the operation, which is clear, achievable within a limited timeframe and a source of significant upside.
* and not only the management
- must have a competitive spirit, including the Board of the company and its investors.
* An exit path, which respects the ambitions of the investors and gives a prosperous future to the company.

The genuine resource of companies financed by private equity funds is and will remain the people in these companies, and their ability to seize opportunities, as well as manage risk and uncertainties (Chapter 6). Entrepreneurs may be the unique missing resource required to operate private equity investments in the future, and not capital - due notably to an increased risk aversion of the population in Europe and the USA.

In fact, entrepreneurs are the yardstick to measure the excess or lack of capital available. A social, economic and legal framework which encourages the adoption of measured risks is in fact facilitating entrepreneur (see Figure 5.2). Taking risks does not mean importing practices from other countries, but adapting some of these practices to the local socio-economic framework. Facilitating entrepreneur represents possibly the most important challenge for governments willing to have dynamic and healthy private equity activity. Training is crucial, as well as tax, legal and social support - so that a creator or a buy-out entrepreneur does not take unnecessary risks for himself and his family.

Figure 5.2 appears to show a recovery in the USA and globally in terms of entrepreneurial activity. However, the reality is much more mixed. A closer look at the USA, as the bellweather of entrepreneurship and the market which is best documented, shows that indeed the start-up activity index has recovered (Figure 5.3). However, the rate of new entrepreneurs has not increased significantly (confirming our developments on valuations of start-ups in previous chapters), as shown in Figure 5.4. The main reason is that some of the entrepreneurs captured in Figure 5.3 are launching a venture because they have no choice. This is a survival strategy, as it is confirmed that a significant proportion are immigrants (Figure 5.5), with a Latino ethnicity (Figure 5.6) and no formal education (Figure 5.7).

* [42] M. C. C.

* [14] M. C. C.

In that context, not only are immigrants more prone to start a company, but the proportion has increased over time. In the case of native-born entrepreneurs, the proportion has been declining mildly except during the 2008-2009 recession, illustrating again that entrepreneurship can be a survival strategy. As the job situation in the USA has been improving, notably over the course of the last years tracked by Figure 5.5, native-born individuals have been drawn to traditional formal employment.

The proportion of entrepreneurs who voluntarily chose to become so, to create a viable venture and not just try to be self-employed, varies significantly over time (Figure 5.8). It fell significantly in 2001-2002, then further in 2009-2011. As the economic conditions improved, the proportion of voluntary entrepreneurs increased substantially, back to the level last seen in 1999-2000. Still, roughly 14% of the total did not choose to be independent and had to adopt a survival strategy. Entrepreneurs by choice are essentially in the same proportion whether they are immigrants or native-born (Figure 5.9). The proportion of immigrants who chose to be entrepreneurs varies much more significantly over time than the proportion of native-born. Foreign entrepreneur is much more sensitive to macro-economic conditions in the USA than native-born.

The picture differs substantially when looking at the composition of the sample of entrepreneurs who choose to be so (See Figure 5.10). The highest proportion is Asian ethnicity, followed by White, Latino and Black. This confirms that the initial perspective provided by Figure 5.6 included a significant proportion of self-employed individuals without any other choice. Ethnicity produces different outcomes in chosen entrepreneurship. Asian entrepreneurs appear to be fairly resilient, except after 2001, but did not stop their entrepreneurial efforts in 2008-2009, while White entrepreneurs did not significantly resume after 2001 and reduced their initiatives even further after 2009. The recovery after is the most visible; they almost caught up with the level prior to the crisis of 2000-2001.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

The starkest contrast lies in the educational background. Entrepreneurs by choice are the most educated, and the level of entrepreneurly declines with education (Figure 11). Thus, if the Latino immigrant with no formal education, forced to be self-employed, was an emblematic entrepreneur of the previous sample, this sample features a highly educated Asian native or immigrant who decides to start up. If the entrepreneur is a woman, she is highly likely to have chosen to be so (Figure 12), regardless of the macro-economic conditions, much more than her male counterpart. The logical conclusion is that, for all the talk about promoting female entrepreneurly, most women entrepreneurs choose to be so. The gender imbalance might not be as clear cut as usually discussed, especially as males are more often forced to work self-employed with no other choice than women.

Figure 13 provides further insights on the composition of the sample of entrepreneurs who choose to be so. First, the oldest cohort drives the pack, a fact which is a far cry from the myth of the young college dropout deciding to start up. However, the prevalence tends to decrease over time. Second, the 45-54 cohort appears to be relatively constant but is very sensitive to macro-economic conditions. It was recently overtaken by the 35-44 cohort, although this might be related to very favourable macro-economic conditions similar to those preceding 2000-2001, a period during which they were at par.

The most striking evolution is the decline of entrepreneurly among the youngest category of 20-34-year-olds. While it was fairly close to the 35-54 cohort combined

in 2001, it declined steadily and became the laggard in 2006. It only partially recovered recently and still lags the other generations significantly. This means that the entrepreneurial spirit of the younger population might not be as strong as it was two decades go. This would also result in a durably lower level of voluntary entrepreneurial effort, stabilising at roughly half what it was three decades ago (See Figure 5.14). As the US population has grown, the absolute number of ventures might not decrease, but the proportion has dropped significantly. With a lower proportion of older entrepreneurs, the chance of seeing a significant increase is limited. As the previous cohorts age, however, they might decide to take the leap.

Private Markets in Teange Time

Trend Setting, Fads and Responsibilities

Private market operators strove to stay below the radar, but this no longer applies. As fund managers gain in importance and go public, are private markets going to stay private much longer?

As private market investing grows, it attracts more attention. It may move towards an organised market, which appears to contradict its nature. The increased participation of institutional investors in private market funds is driving the transformation of this market (Chapter 6). The financial power of multi-billion-dollar funds, in LBO but also increasingly in other private markets, raises some questions regarding the ethical rules applied by fund managers (Chapter 7).

## Chapter 3 Private Markets Evolution Trends or Buzzes?

The growing interaction between listed and private markets has raised many questions, chiefly: is private equity going mainstream? (See Section 6.1.) As it evolves slowly into an institutionalised area for investments, this capital inflow may change the way private equity creates value (see Section 6.2). This could also raise the prospect of more bubbles (see Section 6.3). This section will focus specifically on private equity within private markets, as this is the most developed and advanced set of investment strategies within private markets. Private equity should therefore provide a fairly good perspective on what would happen to other private market strategies as they mature.

### _Is Private Equity Going Mainstream?_

#### 3.1.1 Large and Mega LB0 Funds have Flexed their Muscles...

Large and mega1 LBO funds have demonstrated their ever-increasing financial strength. They compete with corporate strategic buyers for acquisitions. Stock exchanges provide not only an exit path for their deals, but also a source of deal flow. Very few listed companies are now out of the reach of private equity firms. At the peak of the business cycle leading to the 2008-2009 crisis, Microsoft was even named in a paper from the _Financial Times_ as being a possible target for a deal.2 The roster of deals at that time is indeed impressive. In 2006, Equity Office Properties3 delisted for USD 36 billion by Blackstone. HCA delisted for USD 33 billion by Bain Capital, KKR and Merrill Lynch. Harrah's4 delisted for USD 27.8 billion by Apollo and TPG. Kinder Morgan delisted for USD 22 billion by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Carlyle, Riverstone and AIG. Clear

TXU became the largest LBO ever made, a title held for a long time by RJR Nabisco, which was acquired in 1988 by KKR for USD 25.1 billion. It also became, as RJR Nabisco, the beacon of the peak of the cycle. RJR Nabisco is assumed to have generated a loss of USD 730 million on a USD 3.5 billion investment.7 TXU failed spectacularly, along with Harrah's. Freescale and First Data Corporation were close to following the same track and ultimately generated a loss for their investors. These high-profile failures triggered questions about LBO fund managers as being too greedy and careless. The SEC in the USA started to investigate the practice of club deals, seen as potentially anti-competitive.

Footnote 7: Now part of NXP Semiconductors, which acquired it in 2015.

The aftermath of 2008-2009 led to multiple and substantial changes in LBOs. First, the SEC and then its European counterpart ESMA issued recommendations for structuring financial leverages in LBOs. Fund managers are advised to limit their debt levels to six times EBITDA. Second, fund managers took the cue from the SEC investigation in club deals and decided to switch and structure their deals through co-investments with their fund investors, if the deals exceeded the target deal size for the fund. Third, fund managers saw increased competition from corporate buyers, who could access large pools of cheap debt without any cap on their leverage ratio. Fourth, some fund investors decided to do direct deals alone and acquire potential LBO targets.

#### 6.1.3... But Large Deals are Here to Stay

LBO funds have seen their share of global mergers and acquisitions fluctuate between 14% and 19%. According to the White & Case Mergermarket M&A Explorer, LBO funds were buyers in 2753 out of 14 700 deals (18.7%) in 2006, and 2959 of 16 112deals (18.4%) in 2007. The proportion dropped to 1397 out of 9920 deals (14.1%) in 2009. It was only in 2016 and 2017 that the proportion recovered, with respectively 3015 out of 18 593 deals (16.2%) and 3530 out of 19 973 deals (17.7%).

However, very large operations decreased in number and size after 2009 but did not disappear. In 2013, 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway acquired HJ Heinz for USD 23.2 billion, merged in 2015 with Kraft for a combined value of USD 50 billion. Interestingly, the two companies were not taken private but remained listed, with the combined entity on NASDAQ. The same year, Dell was taken private by Michael Dell and Silver Lake for USD 24.4 billion, which acquired EMC for USD 67 billion in 2015. In 2014, PetSmart was bought in the UK for USD 8.7 billion by BC Partners. In 2015, Veritas was acquired from Symantec for USD 8 billion by Carlyle Group and GIC.

#### 6.1.4 The Importance of Public-to-Private Deals

The above list illustrates the trend for listed companies to go private through an LBO. A growing number of listed firms leave the stock exchange so as to avoid the pressure of increased regulation (Sarbanes-Oxley has been blamed for costs and administrative burdens) and quarterly reporting. This was explicitly the motivation of Michael Dell to take the company that he founded and managed private. Listing the company again, as was announced in 2018, tends to contradict this motivation. The number of public-to-private deals reached 421 in 2006 and 395 in 2007, fell to 27 in 2009, and then recovered to 179 in 2017 and 227 in 2018 according to Bain and Company (2019).

The costs and benefits of a listing have changed. Companies which do not find relays of financing on the market, because of a stagnating share price and/or a lack of interest from analysts, view a delisting as a source of flexibility and a way to get the necessary capital injection in order to boost their growth. This phenomenon has mainly been observed in the USA thus far, but is spreading to other markets.

Private equity has grown symbiotically with the stock exchange, but is now organised as an ecosystem, which can finance companies at every stage of their development. Not only may a company grow theoretically through multiple rounds of financing by venture and growth capital, and then later on be taken over by an LBO fund, but it could also be refinanced by LBO funds regularly, through secondary, tertiary and quaternary operations (Frans Bonhomme, in France, has been the target of five successive LBOs between 1994 and 2006). Private equity is gaining its autonomy from traditional exit paths (trade sales and IPOs), even though secondary venture capital funds have yet to emerge formally.

This independence gives private equity the characteristics of an institutionalised and organised market. This is not only true for the exit side, but also the deal sourcing side, where auctions are more frequent in large and now mid-market buy-outs. LBO funds are now surrounded by service providers for their due diligence processes, such as lawyers, auditors, consultants, market analysts and bankers. Buyers' due diligence is common, but vendors' due diligence is also established increasingly in order to negotiate in good faith and have a common basis for discussion.

#### 6.1.5 Private Equity Strives on Innovation

Given its private nature and lack of transparency, can private equity survive in an organised market? The answer lies probably in its flexibility and its ability to innovate. Private

development of the the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of theportfolio company, as well as spreading the risk between multiple investors. For large buy-outs, the same reasoning may apply.

Blackstone, KKR, Apollo and other mega LBO fund managers regularly raise USD 20 billion funds9 to invest in mega buy-outs. However, with deals above USD 30 billion, even after leverage, it is necessary to spread the risk among multiple investors. Moreover, in the HCA deal, the investors include a typical private equity house, with a fund associated with a consulting firm and an investment bank. These three players provide different skillsets for the portfolio company and thus have an interest in teaming up.

Footnote 9: As a matter of illustration, Apollo raised a USD 25 billion fund in 2017.

On a fund investor level, however, club deals or co-investments bring an overall reduction in the diversification of the portfolio. If a fund investor is in multiple funds co-investing in the same company, its portfolio may be over-exposed to a specific risk. The same applied for co-investments. The fund investor may also be investing in funds competing with each other for a certain company, and thus bidding against each other. The funds it has invested in will support this price increase (for the winning bidder) and also broken deal costs (for the defeated bidder).

#### 6.1.7 The temptation of Permanent Capital

Private equity fund managers have to regularly fundraise. This process is time and resource-consuming, and fairly expensive (even though the costs are effectively supported by fund investors through the fund's set-up costs). It is also one of the few instances during which fund investors have the choice to reinvest or not with the same fund manager. Fundraising forces the fund manager to go back to the drawing board and explain the strategy (and its adjustment), past investments, value creation, exits, performance, failures and successes, and ultimately convince the fund investors. This process is therefore demanding and forces fund managers to face tough questions. This is probably one of the few times that they have to exercise restraint and show some form of humility. Fund investors, the real owners of private equity funds, can exercise their right to operate a detailed due diligence and leave no stone unturned.

The temptation for fund managers is therefore to set up a pool of permanent capital, to avoid such a consuming process and also to increase their discretion and freedom. Two main conduits have been tested so far, with rather mixed results: listing vehicles on the stock exchange, and more recently setting up longer-denominated funds.

Multiple fund managers have tried to _list structures_. Three possibilities are offered to them: list a closed-end or an open-end investment vehicle, list the fund manager itself or list a combination of an open-end fund and a fund manager (listed holding). Listing closed-end investment companies (such as BDCs in the USA) funds does not solve the issue of fund managers willing to avoid the regular fundraising of new structures. These structures have to be raised in compliance with regulations applicable to listed markets, which are more demanding than the private placement of funds. They also have to be managed under the scrutiny of listed investors and analysts. In particular, fund managers have to provide a minimum of information about the underlying private companies (or assets), thus to the competitors of these private companies and the The _SAC_ is a special case of the _SAC_. The _SAC_ is a special case of the _SAC_.

a significant lag. Moreover, the details on each underlying asset are scarce. As a result, the listed structure trades at an average 30% discount on the net asset value of the fund. Second, the listed structure suffers from a performance drag associated with the unused capital. When the structure is created, it still requires time to deploy its capital efficiently. The unused capital suffers from an opportunity cost. When the listed structure sells an asset, the capital and the undistributed proceeds will sit idle on the balance sheet until the manager finds another investment opportunity. Third, the alignment of interest between the investors in the listed fund and the managers is looser than with a standard private structure. Fund managers have no pressure to maximise the performance and return the capital to investors. Investors might suffer from implicit opportunity costs as the capital is used but maybe not to their best interest. This explains why listed ('evergreen') funds did not take off as an alternative to the standard private market fund structure. In the case of KKR PEI, it was used for a reverse take-over of KKR itself, the fund manager becoming public and having transferred it to the NYSE.

However, listed private market fund managers themselves did not fare particularly well, as illustrated by KKR (Figure 6.2). The listing of Blackstone in 2007 triggered a wave of listing, with Apollo, Oaktree and many other private market fund managers following through (Figure 6.3). All of them have under-performed the S&P 500. Fund managers provide investors with access to the stream of management fees that they collect as fund managers, as well as their performance fee. In effect, they are asset managers and considered as such by investors - not as a conduit to private market investments. Moreover, investors have only limited visibility on the upcoming performance fees, and no say in the pay and expenses of the employees of the fund managers. The attractiveness of these structures for fund investors is therefore limited.

From the above, it will come as no surprise that listed holding companies did not do better. They combine the drawback of listed fund managers and listed open-end funds, with the added complexity of understanding these two structures with one set of accounts. 3i, Eurazeo, GIMV and some other private equity houses have been offering such vehicles in Europe for a long time without generating a trend.

Another approach, more recent, has been to _set up longer-denominated funds_, created for 15 years or more. The idea of fund managers, such as BlackRock and Blackstone, has been to buy and hold assets, creating value over a longer period of time. This faces multiple obstacles. First, holding assets for a longer time requires a very patient investment team. The performance fee will necessarily come later, and this might not be a sufficient incentive to keep the staff motivated and happy. Second, the investment

plan has to be different than for the traditional private equity operations, or should combine multiple successive plans with the same discipline as when they are executed one after another in successive LBOs. Fund managers have still to prove that they can execute these different strategies or that they can successfully implement very different strategies on one single asset. Third, fund investors have to be more patient than with existing fund structures already perceived as fairly long. So far, the experiment of longer-denominated funds has remained marginal and did not gather momentum.

### Is Private Equity (Still) Creating Value?

The lack of transparency in private markets has often been associated with the source of their performance. Information asymmetries can play in favour of fund managers, used to execute detailed due diligence and handle a relative lack of information (at least compared to the level of information available on stock exchanges).

Among the reasons given as to why private markets deliver higher returns than other traditional asset classes, lack of liquidity is often cited. To be competitive, private

markets would have to deliver an 'illiquidity premium'11 above stock exchange returns, hence compensating a 'higher risk'. Unfortunately, this explanation does not really hold. First, the notion of 'illiquidity premium' only applies to fixed-income investments: the lender gets compensated for postponing the consumption of its capital, as well as for the risk of lending. This is not applicable to equity and active investments. Second, the notion of an 'illiquidity premium' is not compatible with the fact that to operate, private market fund managers require a minimum of 3 to 8 years, depending on the private markets investment strategy that they apply. The lower liquidity of their investments is not a risk but a dimension of investment.

Footnote 11: This has been estimated at between 400 and 600 basis points above average returns on the stock exchange at a fund level.

The second reason that is often given is that private market fund managers create greater value than the typical selection of stocks or bonds, on the stock exchange. In private markets, value creation evolves around what the investor can bring to the investee company (or asset) beyond the capital provided. This can vary from one investor to another, depending on the nature of the investment (venture capital or LBO, for example), the needs of the company (staffing, advice, structuring, M&A, etc.), the specificities of the fund investing in the company (local/international, focused/disverified, etc.) and the personality of the executive representing the fund on the Board. This value creation is often described as a 'hands-on' approach in venture capital, where the executives of the venture capital fund are widely involved in the life and development of their portfolio companies. The limit of this intervention, however, is defined by a simple rule: the investor shall not 'cross the management line'. This is defined mainly by the laws and regulations of each country and may be enforced by local courts.

The distinction between advising and directing can be very narrow. Some venture capital funds in Silicon Valley often assign one of their executives to work within a definite timeframe as an executive in their portfolio companies in order to fill a gap or support a given effort. This is not possible in many European countries, as the sponsors of the funds would be considered 'de facto managers' and thus liable if the company went bankrupt - which is, however, less likely to happen than for other companies which are not backed by private equity players, as was explained in a paper in the _Harvard Business Review_(Salter, 2007).

The management is responsible for the direction of the company, but investors are nevertheless supposed to support, advise and control (if admitted to the controlling organs, such as the Board of Directors) portfolio companies. In that respect, Boards of professionally sponsored buy-outs appear as more informed, hands-on and interventionist than their equivalent in public companies. This is probably a determining factor in the value creation of private equity teams.

This effect is the result of a better alignment of interests between private equity Board members and shareholders, as they are significant shareholders. They not only have an incentive to identify key issues and ask the management to resolve them, but also to do this at an early stage and ask the management proactively for information. This is possible because private equity teams have a deep knowledge of the companies they have invested in, thanks to the initial due diligence they have done and the ongoing detailed monitoring they are exercising.

the structuring and build-up of a company, manage a 'transforming acquisition' and prepare its listing.

LBO funds have, however, been criticised for their quick buy-and-sell strategy, raising some concerns about their value creation. In the USA, Hertz has been acquired from Ford by a consortium of LBO funds and was planned to be listed less than a year after its acquisition. In Europe, Legrand has been listed less than 2 years after its acquisition by KKR and Wendel. Despite the 'first 100 days' plan and operational improvements, the results of value creation by funds have to be shown in the financial statements of the companies. Selling acquisitions less than 2 years after their acquisition raises many questions concerning the efficiency of this strategy.

The increasing number of quick buy-and-sell operations during the last LBO boom was short-lived. Funds, and especially LBO specialists, may find an interest in shortening the holding period of portfolio companies as one of the ways to measure their performance. Funds can deliver very high IRR with relatively modest multiples, if they can manage to rotate their assets quickly. This could explain the focus on quick exits, and notably on PIPEs as the exit issue is partially solved in this latter case.

The rapid delivery of good IRRs through realised investments eases fundraising for subsequent funds. Fund managers may find an incentive to focus on this metric, despite the modest absolute returns generated. Studies have shown that patient investors deliver substantially higher absolute returns than those placing the emphasis on delivering returns quickly. LBO funds show a strong focus on recapitalisations and other financial operations, as they are a way to show partially realised performance and announce flattering IRRs quickly. It is thus in the best interests of the investor to understand how the performance was generated, and especially to factor in the rotation of assets, the leverage effect (and possible recapitalisations), as well as the difference from multiples of EBIT or EBITDA between entry and exit. Once these factors have been identified, it is possible to truly assess the value creation of a given investor by excluding them.

A Citigroup study, published in November 2006, has shown that pure financial operations, and especially leveraging, are not a value creation. According to Michael Gordon (_Financial Times_, 2007), who had access to this research, buy-out funds under-performed public equity in the 1980s and 1990s if the same level of leverage is applied to public equity ownership. The Citigroup team applied the leverage used by private equity firms to a basket of American mid-cap listed stocks and backtested the performance over a 10-year period. The declared annualised return from this portfolio was 38% (above the 36% reported for top-quartile buy-out funds and the 14% for the LBO average). This method remains open to criticism, as it applies a technique to a basket of values which are then backtested. This introduces a certain bias for a real comparison with top-quartile funds. However, the difference in performance between the 38% and the average of the LBO sector still shows that value creation is not systematic when it is a matter of LBO investments, and remains to be assessed carefully in order to further analyse the reproduction of the performance in the future.

Value creation, at every level of the private equity ecosystem, is a reality. Hedge funds have been chasing private equity talent in their quest to find new ways of generating performance. The emblematic operation of the hedge fund KSL, which acquired the bankrupt public retailer Kmart in order to restructure it and later merge it with Sears, has shown clearly that there could be an overlap between private equity investing and hedge fund financing. This overlap remains limited, given the scope of the intervention of these two alternative sub-asset classes. However, hedge funds have carried on chasing talent in private equity, and this trend proves that private equity is able to deliver a consistent and substantial performance through real value creation.

With the diffusion of private equity techniques to other asset classes, whether hedge funds, real estate or other sectors, are private equity techniques in the process of being commoditised? Or, in other words, is private equity going mainstream? These questions lead to the possibility that private equity could see its returns decrease over time. Leveraging an acquisition is a standard procedure which is well known on the market. However, value creation remains a key element of the performance of LBO funds. A study (Cao & Lerner, 2006) has shown that listed companies which were backed by LBO funds were outperforming the market and other IPOs between 1980 and 2002.

Analysing the value creation of private equity firms should go beyond pure IRR and multiple approaches, to go further into deal structuring, execution and exit. Reference calls with CEOs of companies are not only part of the due diligence process for an investor, but also with other parties involved in the investment process, including advisors and bankers. Moreover, the subsequent performance of portfolio companies once exited is important, as this determines whether the company was generating returns for the fund on the verge of a bubble high, or whether it has stood the test of time and could resist not only a listing, but also in the long term the pressure of the market. The crashed IPO of the IP telephony company Vonage (see Figure 6.4) provides an example of the market backlash when a company does not provide sufficient grounds for further development.

### Private equity: Between bubbles and crashes

Private markets are affected by economic, financial and industry-specific cycles. They are influenced by _economic cycles_, as the underlying companies and assets which funds are investing in are affected by these cycles. The level of confidence of consumers, the current and projected demand, the adoption rates of technological innovation and other parameters influence sectors of investment and condition the performance of portfolio companies. Depending on this performance, exits will be more or less lucrative for funds, and thus their performance will be impacted.

Private markets are also affected by _financial cycles_, which are measured by the _percentage of capital allocated_ to the asset class and by _interest rates_. _Capital inflow_ in private markets is one of the ways to measure where we are in the cycle. However, more than the overall capital collected in a given year, it is the total amount collected per segment (such as venture capital, LBO or distressed debt) and sub-segment (hi-tech, biotech, small, mid or large caps, etc.) which is important, as well as the geographical allocation. It is also important to compare the amounts collected, invested and to be invested, as well as the divestments. For a given vintage, the investment period is usually 5 years (less for specific strategies). The holding period of a company varies greatly but is generally 3 to 5 years in private equity, and the divestment process can take some time. It is thus difficult to determine if there is an over-allocation to private markets in terms of capital allocation at a given time.

Capital inflow is dependent on the overall amount to be invested by:

* High net worth individuals, as determined by their liquid personal wealth and the allocation strategy advised by private banks, family offices and foundations.
* Insurers and banks, as determined by solvency and prudential ratios, the total assets under management and the allocation strategy of these institutions.
* Corporations, as determined by their net results, the total of their assets and their investment policy.
* Pension funds and plans, as determined by their total assets under management and their allocation strategy.

These criteria can create booms and busts in private markets. A change in the allocation strategy of pension plans can suddenly liberate a vast amount of capital to be invested in a relatively short period of time in private markets. This is what happened when CalPERS and CalSTRS and other pension funds in the USA decided to increase their exposure to this asset class in order to improve the performance of their investment portfolio. The sudden capital inflow could create conditions for a sub-optimal allocation, as it is difficult to evaluate what is the right size for private markets and the investment opportunities for a given year.

A change in the calculation of the prudential or solvency ratio can also have a dramatic impact as well. The Basel II and III Agreements have redefined the calculation methods for banks to evaluate their risk and to cover it. Suddenly, the private equity sector was weighted differently owing to the risk it was assigned, and financial institutions had to cover their commitments with more capital off their balance sheet. By increasing the cost of capital for banks to invest in private equity, the Basel II and III

### Conclusion

As a matter of synthesis, private markets could be described as a financial ecosystem living in symbiosis with the listed and non-listed markets. If private equity is able to finance a company at any stage of its development, it is, however, not a must-have for all companies (see Section 6.1). The optimal size of the sector remains to be assessed, due notably to the time-lag effect, but there is no capital overhang (see Section 6.2).

#### 6.4.1 There is No Such Thing as 'Capital Quehang'

Each crisis affecting private equity is an occasion to doubt its viability, its future and even its role. The liquidity crisis of 2007-2009 was one of them. That crisis has led fund managers to lengthen the deployment time of their capital. Nevertheless, fund investors are still increasing their allocation to private markets. The apparent contradiction appears to drive observers to conclude too quickly that there is a mismatch between what is raised (Figure 6.6) and what can be deployed.

The question is: too much capital compared to what? Private equity represents roughly 4% of the market capitalisation of listed companies, which themselves represent 1% of the companies of the OECD. The potential pool of investment opportunities seems to be fairly large, even though no active company in the world is a potential target for a private equity investment. The underlying criticism of capital overhang is that some fund managers are accumulating capital, are unable to deploy it and will be unable to generate the expected returns. A small demonstration illustrates the difficulty of making such a statement confidently.

#### Elements of Analysis

At first glance, year on year, the funds raised are overshadowing the amounts invested. This was the case, for example, in Europe over the period 1997-2011, with the exception of 1999, 2002-2004 and 2009-2011 (see Figure 6.7). Even worse, divestments are showing an increasing gap with investments. According to a year-on-year analysis, private equity would accumulate funds and be unable to liquidate its portfolio.

This is not the case. A first approach tends to prove that there is not too much capital (Figure 6.8). This illusion is attributed to the specificities of private equity, such as:

1. A capital deployment of funds raised over the course of the following 3 years. The correct assessment implies smoothing the funds raised according to a cash-flow pattern which is common to most private equity funds. To do so, the following simplified pattern of capital deployment has been used: [1993]* [25] M. C. C.

As LBO secondaries are slowly developing as a major exit scenario for LBOs (or transfer from VC to LBO ownership, as IPOs are still at a very low level), the 'dry powder' is put to use and probably contributes to structuring a sector with its own dynamics.

It is not the volumes, but the acceleration and deceleration of capital deployment which are the most prejudicial to private equity. The core of the debate is thus the expected performance, which is conditioned by the amounts allocated to the sector and the timing of this allocation.

Obviously, the bubbles have been generated by an acceleration of the investments, as was the case in 1998-2000 and 2005-2006. On the contrary, the corrections of 2001 and 2008-2009 also appear clearly. The inversion of the curves in 2002 and 2009 have repercussions for the returns on investments: these are some of the vintage years generating the best returns on investment.

The collective responsibility of fund investors is in that respect very important in the determination of future rates of return (see in that regard Mulcahy, Weeks & Bradley, 2012). Paradoxically, it is the fund investors which are increasing brutally and massively their allocations to private equity (which is in fact ill-prepared for this massive and brutal capital inflow) that are contributing the most to the degradation of performance of the sector.

The question is therefore the following: are fund investors able to adopt a certain Malthusianism and master the deployment of their capital collectively? Or can they support a strong dynamic of financial innovation and place private equity in the ranks of asset classes to be backed as such? This would mean revising the number of fund managers applying the same investment strategy and bidding for the same assets, facilitating the concentration of these structures to lower the fees per euro invested. With regard to these questions, the maturity of fund investors as to these issues remains to be assessed.

## Chapter 7 Private Equity and Ethics

_A Culture Clash_

It is no small claim to make that until the emergence of private markets as a modern financial sector (see Chapter 2), there would have been no reason to write this chapter at all. Prior to that the subject of ethics was either aligned with entrepreneurial spirit through what Adam Smith described as 'acting in one's and at the same time the general public's best interest'; or was associated with religious and political endeavours and had no chance to be assessed separately - and even less to be debated.

The emergence of the rule of law has separated practices which used to be connected, such as setting the rules and benefitting from them; or the roles of manager and controller being combined in one person. The professionalisation of private markets has also introduced separation between principal and agent (see Chapter 2), which has increased the potential for conflicts of interest.

The list of potential malpractices would be very long and it is not the purpose of this chapter to list them all, but to understand their dynamics, make an attempt at classification and derive some lessons from them. Private equity being a small and mainly local activity until 20 years ago, fund investors and managers would know each other well. The sanction of an ethical breach would be simply the exclusion of the sector, as word spread fast amongst the community of private equity stakeholders. With a massive influx of capital, private markets had to face a sudden change in the number of participants in the private markets value chain, and the volume of potential breaches involved. The sanction of ethical breach was far less easy to apply, and the law - the last resort - was used more often.

The more an economic sector develops, the more it tempts individuals willing to benefit from this growth at all costs. Legal sanctions are not enough to guarantee that private markets can be practised in safe conditions (see Section 7.1). As getting rich quick is considered to be socially abnormal, successful individuals decided to buy themselves some moral credentials through philanthropy (see Section 7.2). To limit inequalities and establish some boundaries for market or public intervention, the main rule which was applied was transparency (see Section 7.3). However, this solution has proven to be imperfect, and private markets have to work on deontology, self-regulation and ethical behaviour (see Section 7.4). It is only checks and balances that can reconcile the market's need for flexibility and the public's need for collective and individual protection from predatory practices.

### Greb

The financial crisis has exposed some of the hidden practices of financial agents. Private markets have evolved within the space of approximately two generations from a traditional and informal practice to a separation between investors and investment managers. By comparison, the stock exchange has had a hundred years of evolution in which to cope with its increasing sophistication and transformation. In that sense, private markets provide a mixed picture, dominated by a certain _greed_ on the part of fund managers. However, the main challenge, once this transition was made - along with the emergence of new ethical standards, was to manage the long-term and potentially disruptive and destructive impact of private equity.

_Fraud: AA Capital Partners and John Orecchio (USA)_

A few cases of _obvious fraud_ emerged, such as that at AA Capital Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm.1 The firm managed USD 200 million for six unions and advised on pension funds from 2002 to 2006. One of the two founders, John Orecchio, had spent money on travel, entertainment and in a Detroit strip club where he had a mistress, according to the SEC (FinAlternatives, 2009). Orecchio bought some real estate in Michigan for his mistress and her mother, including a horse farm (also covering the costs of renovation), a boat, luxury automobiles and jewellery worth a total of USD 1.4 million.

Footnote 1: Another case emerged in 2017, with Andrew Caspersen, a former principal at Coller Capital and executive at Park Hill, specialised in secondaries investing. He was convicted of securities and wires fraud and sentenced to 4 years in prison. He created a fake credit facility related to a staple secondary transaction, trying to defraud two institutional investors out of USD 95 million to feed his gambling habit. The lack of transparency which characterises private markets, and specifically the secondary sector, provided the ‘perfect cover’ for this fraud, according to Igor Rozenblitz, co-head of the private equity funds unit at the SEC.

In 2004, Orecchio asked AA Capital Partners' CFO to withdraw money from the client trust accounts, to put it into AA Capital's operating account, before wiring it into his personal account. At least 20 withdrawals were made for a total of USD 5.7 million.

The SEC also described how Orecchio lied to his partner Oliver about a real-estate development investment, stating that the costs amounted to USD 8.7 million when he had in fact invested only USD 1.3 million. The remaining USD 6.9 million was used to renovate the above-mentioned real estate belonging to his mistress (the horse farm and strip club) and for the acquisition of a condomium in Las Vegas.

Orecchio also claimed reimbursement for expenses that were not billable to AA Capital's clients: political contributions, visits to casinos and strip clubs, and tickets to concerts or events. To fulfil a need for income of USD 10 million, the CFO withdrew money from the client accounts. Orecchio benefitted from the help of his business partner and the CFO of the firm.

In this case, the violation of the law is clear: an investment advisor engaged in transactions, did business and employed practices at the expense of his investors. However, not all frauds are so obvious, and thus detectable by the SEC.

_Fraud: Private Equity Management and Danny Pang (Asia)_

In another case which was investigated (AltAssets, 2009), Danny Pang, founder and former chief executive of Private Equity Management, was accused of having used hisfamily members as employees in order to cash cheques, the amount of which remained just below USD 10 000 (the minimum threshold for filing transaction reports). The total amount is assumed to have reached USD 83 million. In another case, Pang was accused of defrauding investors based in Asia for many million dollars (between USD 287 and 654 million). In both these cases, the alleged fraudster used geographical distance and a certain legal flexibility in order to misappropriate funds.

Geographical distance plays a role not only in variations between legal systems, but also in cultural differences. Many investors have invested in emerging markets on the assumption that the local fund managers - sometimes educated in Western universities - were conforming to Western business practices. However, the perception of conflicts of interest and good business practice in China and India may differ substantially from that which is perceived as such in the OECD. In particular, some countries may not have reached the degree of political, social and economic maturity which forms the background for modern private equity in Europe and the USA.

Interpretative and cultural differences are not merely anecdotal in private equity. As discussed in Chapter 5, human interactions are at the centre of the generation of deal flow, the investment process, investment management and divestment management. It is especially difficult to draw a clear line between what is an exchange of services and what is the misappropriation of interests. For example, doing business in China may imply spending money in order to gain access to certain attractive opportunities.

_Fraud: Abraaj Group, Arif Naqvi and KPMG (Middle East)_

In a similar fashion, the executives of Abraaj Group defrauded fund investors. Created in 2002, this fund manager quickly rose to be the largest in the Middle East, managing USD 14 billion, having launched 30 funds in private equity, private debt, private real estate and energy strategies, as well as an impact investing activity dedicated to Africa, Asia, Latin America and Turkey. In 2015 alone, the structure raised USD 1.4 billion to invest in Africa. The firm faced recurring issues of overspending, accumulating losses and debts.

In 2018, fund investors, among them the IFC and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, accused the fund manager of mismanaging capital of USD 230 million from a USD 1 billion healthcare fund. USD 300 million appeared to be missing from its USD 1.6 billion Fund IV. KPMG was mandated to investigate the case and exonerated the firm. However, the auditing firm had very close ties to Abraaj. The CEO of KPMG in Dubai had a son who worked at Abraaj, notably; and was the auditor of portfolio companies of Abraaj. The case was further complicated by the fact that the funds raised before 2013 did not have any external administrator.

Abraaj applied for provisional liquidation in June 2018. In 2019, the Dubai Financial Services Authority fired the group USD 315 million for deceiving investors, misusing investor funds to cover operational expenses and carrying out unauthorised activities. In the USA, the same year, the founder of Abraaj Arif Naqvi and other senior executives were indicted for misappropriating funds to cover operational expenses. Naqvi himself is accused of personally misappropriating USD 250 million, and is under house arrest in London at the time of writing.

British fund manager Actis took over the management of Abraaj's fourth buyout fund, as well as one of its African funds. American fund managers TPG and Colony Capital have taken over its healthcare fund and Latin American fund.

**Collusions and insider trading (France)**

In 2007 in France, the Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) investigated potential collusion between hedge funds and private equity funds (names were not disclosed) to force a listed company to accept a buy-out (Mackintosh & Arnold, 2007). There was a suspicion that activist funds pushed the management into selling the companies while having at the same time a pre-arranged sales agreement with some buy-out firms. The collusion of different actors is especially difficult to detect and can cause severe damage to the economy.

**Collusion and insider trading: New Silk Route and Galleon (India)**

Insider trading is difficult to prove, notably in the case of private equity. Nevertheless, connections are sometimes a hint that some fund managers are built on a fragile basis. This is the case of New Silk Route, an 'Asia-focused growth capital firm focused on the Indian subcontinent' (see Primack, 2011), which is connected to three persons convicted in the USA for insider trading:

* Rajat Gupta, who was charged in the Galleon Management case, is chairman and co-founder of the firm which manages USD 1.4 billion.
* Raj Rajaratnam, who was also convicted in the Galleon Management case, was listed in 2008 as a principal of the firm. New Silk Route (formerly known as Taj Capital) originally allocated USD 600 million to invest in the Galleon hedge funds, hence raising deep concerns in terms of management of conflicts of interest.
* Victor Menezes, who was investigated in 2006 by the SEC for insider trading of USD 30 million for selling Citigroup stocks just before the bank announced major losses related to the Argentinean debt crisis. He settled with the SEC without admitting or denying any wrongdoing for USD 2.7 million.

Such a network of dubious individuals raises concerns when fund investors have to select emerging fund managers on emerging markets. At the time of investment in New Silk Route, these facts were unknown (except maybe for Victor Menezes). However, this case illustrates the difficulty of analysing the quality of a fund manager and the need for thorough due diligence.2

Footnote 2: This can go as far as recruiting private investigators such as Kroll to assess the background of individuals and their situation when the information is scarce – notably on emerging markets.

_Collusion and corruption: 'pay to play' (USA)_

Another illustration of collusion (and corruption) is the so-called 'pay-to-play' scandal. Nineteen private equity firms3 were awarded advisory mandates by pension funds and public investment vehicles as a reward for donations to the campaigns of elected officials (FinAlternatives, 2009). As a result, the SEC have barred investment firms whose executives and employees donate to the campaigns of elected officials from being awarded such mandates.

This measure was the consequence of an investigation by Attorney-General Andrew Cuomo, who revealed that placement agents paid kickbacks to the New York Comptroller in exchange for mandates from the NY Common Retirement Fund. These placement agents (namely Aldus Equity) were acting in the name of private equity and hedge fund managers. The Attorney-General settled the case in exchange for fines (USD 20 million for Carlyle) and an agreement that these groups would stop using placement agents from that point on.

Whether these measures will help to prevent future scandals of this nature is difficult to assess. Placement agents have a genuine function in gaining access to capital providers, notably because they know the executives who make the decisions. This saves time and money in the fundraising process. Moreover, it is especially difficult to exclude some sort of bargaining in the award of such mandates, notably because of the human element in their devolution. If there were no financial rewards involved, there could be other forms of compensation that would be difficult to trace or even to criticise.

What if a politician is a direct, or even more difficult, indirect (through funds of funds, for example) fund investor in a fund; that this fund is awarded a mandate; and that this mandate has been distributed with the consent of this politician? Would it be bad? Yes, _if_ the politician gives the mandate on the basis that he knows the fund manager. No, _because_ the politician gives the mandate on the same grounds. In the first case, there is a violation of the rules of impartiality which regulate the administration of public money and the set-up of calls for tender offers. In the second case, there is compliance with the best practices of private equity which require an investor to know the fund manager with whom he is investing. He would not choose an incompetent fund manager because he has put his own money in the fund managed by this particular fund manager. He would hence align his interests and the public's interest. But he may be tempted to choose the fund manager because he has invested with it.

Should we 'ban the politicians' from such decisions, as was suggested (Private Equity Online, 2009)? The debate stands between people who are accountable for their decisions (politicians) and people who are not (administrative executives). Politicians need to be elected, which costs money, but can be ousted for bad management/results. Administrative executives have the security of the job, and thus are theoretically less prone to corruption, but also more difficult to fire for bad management/results.

_Valuation manipulation and fundraising: Roc Resources (USA)_

The SEC launched an investigation in 2012 on Roc Resources4 (formerly Oppenheimer & Co's private equity firm, which spun off 2 weeks after the start of the investigation; see Zuckerman, 2012). The fund of funds invested in a Romanian holding, valued at USD 6 million as of 30 June 2009 (NAV). During a fundraising in November 2009,the valuation was USD 9.2 million, still announced as of 30 June 2009 (NAV). Primack (2012a) states that 'the change increased the fund's overall net IRR from -6.3% to +38.3%'. The fund raised more than USD _55_ million from individuals and institutions.

This valuation is contentious, because the underlying asset was listed on the OTC, so it had a public price (7 cents for the Romanian assets vs 20 cents reported by investors). The Romanian asset was worth USD 2 million based on trading, reported at USD 6 million by its holding (Cartesian Capital) and at USD 9.3 million by Oppenheimer.

_Excessive fee collection: Lincolnshire Management (USA)_

Acconci Trust has sued Lincolnshire Management for not distributing the proceeds from a court decision to award USD 99 million in a case involving Cendent Corp (Vardi, 2011). The Trust claims that Lincolnshire Equity Fund wrongfully deducted fees, expenses and interest and misappropriated an additional USD 7.6 million from the case. Lincolnshire Management denies any wrongdoing.

In 2004 Acconci Trust bought a stake in the Lincolnshire Equity Fund 1994 on the secondary market - it owns 51% of the fund managed by Lincolnshire Management. The management fee is capped at 2% of assets under management, and all fees above the cap have to be returned to the fund. After selling a portfolio company (Credentials Services International) in 1998 to Cendant for USD 125 million plus an earn-out, Cendant was sued for breaching the terms of the agreement. Out of the USD 99 million awarded in 2009 by the court, USD 74 million remained in 2009 after legal fees, but only USD 45 million was distributed to the limited partners. Lincolnshire was charging 'litigation expenses' of USD 4.1 million and interest on amounts advanced for expenses of USD 1 million. USD 5 million was charged for the time spent on the dispute, and USD 7.6 million deducted as a refund of an unrecorded loan.

In 2014, Lincolnshire Management paid USD 2.3 million to the SEC to settle other charges of improper expense allocations, involving two of its funds' investments in Peripheral Computer Support, which subsequently acquired Computer Technology Solutions. The SEC accused the fund manager of breaching its fiduciary duty to the two private equity funds when it misallocated costs related to its management to Computer Technology Solutions. In practice, it favoured one fund over the other.

_Excessive fund extension: Bebrman Capital (USA)_

In 2000, Behrman Capital raised USD 1.2 billion for its third LBO fund (Primack, 2012b). In 2012, the fund raised USD 1 billion, because the fund manager refused to liquidate the fund's five remaining portfolio companies. Primack states that while'some limited partners are pleased that they're getting bought out [...] others are livid [... as] all of them are practically powerless to do anything about it'. This is an example of secondary operation where the fund manager is the buyer and the seller of the assets, in a so-called GP-led restructuring.

Indeed, Behrman sold the portfolio for USD 750 million, plus an additional USD 250 million for new investments, to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and additional investors. Hence, Behrman gets the carried interest on the current exit and will get additional carried on the upcoming liquidations, as it remains the fund manager. Meanwhile, it will receive management fees.

Primack explains: 'Can't the LPs [limited partners] just refuse to let this happen? Technically yes. Pragmatically no. Imagine the LPs refused to accept this deal. What is their next move? Hire a new GP or consultant to manage out the remaining portfolio - one that is less familiar with the underlying companies? Simply refuse to keep paying fees to Behrman GPs - ok, but what incentive do Behrman GPs have to show up at work [...]?'

As a conclusion: 'Behrman also gets to raise new primary capital (which generates brand new fees) without formal fundraising process (like the one that largely failed in 2007). In short, it's just another example of how general partners hold almost all the cards, no matter how the original agreement is written.'

Since then, the practice of GP-led restructuring has developed and gained ground. The potential conflicts of interest are largely unresolved, but the practice is increasingly frequent.

_Potential solutions and evolutions_

The solution may lie in the separation of functions, between control and decision, with real sanctions when one fails. Another can be seen in the fact that everyone has to be on the control side of other actors in the private equity chain, while also taking their own decisions, which are controlled by the others. Even though this does not guarantee an absence of misbehaviour, it helps to prevent it. If control is assumed by more than one player, then it is difficult to fool the controllers substantially and on a recurring basis.

At the moment, these financial checks and balances do not exist. This is why the fund manager's personality, integrity and ethics need to be assessed carefully. This is becoming increasingly difficult.

The first difficulty stems from the lack of references and immersion in the fund manager's environment. Despite lists of references that a fund investor may call upon - usually friends and business partners of the former - it is difficult to learn about his reputation, actions and overall his philosophy of investing.

The second difficulty is related to the professionalisation of fund manager. Speeches and documents are polished until they almost reach perfection, and it is difficult to get behind this facade. The lack of time for both fund investors and managers reduces their interaction and their ability to gain mutual understanding of their respective approaches.

In the short term, regulators have ramped up their efforts. The SEC has 'launched a wide-ranging inquiry into the private equity industry, particularly with respect to insider trading and how firms address conflicts of interest' (Burwell, 2012). The SEC will notably control whether private equity fund managers (managing more than USD 150 million) comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, as 'investment advisers' and have effective policies and procedures to prevent insider trading.

As for conflicts of interest, Burwell mentions that the SEC focused on the following questions:

* The use of consistent and documented valuation methods.
* The use of side letters to give certain fund investors preferential treatment.
* Fundraising beyond the operational means to deploy the capital raised, to maximise the fees.
* The allocation of opportunities between multiple funds managed by a single fund manager.
* The accuracy of the reporting to fund investors in terms of fund performance.
* The determination and disclosure of fees charged to portfolio companies.
* The management of 'zombie' companies, notably in case of extension of the lives of mature funds.

More importantly, the positions created in a start-up might have eliminated one or more in the larger economy. The positions eliminated in the larger economy have to be taken into account. An illustration would be the replacement of employed taxi drivers with a stable position by precarious freelancers in the so-called gig economy.

As for net job creation in the case of LBO, the case rests on observing the evolution of companies on an aggregate basis over the mid term. However, in the short term, an acquisition might lead to the suppression of positions. This stresses the economic and social system until the company creates new positions, which might be filled by different profiles. The result might be unemployed workers with skills difficult to reuse or change, the cost of which is supported collectively - instead of having the company taking over this task through training and reconversion of its workforce.

_Growing responsibilities_

Is economic growth fuelled by private market investments? Venture and growth capital participate in the emergence of companies and new activities. LBO could have an impact on long-term productivity gains, even though the scale of its contribution to long-term GDP growth has yet to be demonstrated. As private equity's influence grows along with the amount of capital it manages, its responsibilities increase correspondingly.

Adopting the vision of private equity as part of the financial and economic ecosystem means that private equity must assume the burden which comes with its new position - and generate positive externalities. Private equity not only plays a crucial role in the development of the countries in which it invests, but also influences how the companies in which it invests will behave with regard to their social, economic and general environment.

Private equity creates value through better governance (Guo, Hotchkiss & Song, 2008 for LBOs; Gompers & Xuan, 2008 for venture capital) and tighter monitoring (Katz, 2008 - this applies to LBOs but is true for venture capital too). Thus, fund managers have the tools to exert a critical influence on the behaviour of the management of their portfolio companies. They are able to dictate the requirements of respecting the ethical, social and environmental criteria which are demanded by sustainable development at an early stage.

This goes beyond the typical pledges made by large firms about their commitment to act in favour of protecting the environment or against climate change. These are merely cosmetic measures and a matter of fashionable corporate image ('green washing'). Private equity fund managers' concentration of ownership gives them the power and the responsibility to act in support of these principles. They have the financial resources to apply - and even to develop - state-of-the-art measuring tools and to contribute actively to the establishment of triple bottom line evaluation (economic, social and environmental). In this respect, they have no excuse for lagging behind the meagre efforts of listed companies.

_Towards the internalisation of externalities: the triple bottom line_

What could push fund managers to act in favour of the development of this triple bottom line is the importance of their _reputation_. As we have seen earlier in this chapter, fund investors are extremely sensitive to the reputation of fund managers, and even more so since the sector has expanded rapidly and widely. Many academic papers show that the reputation of fund managers, whether in venture capital (Gompers & Xuan, 2008; Hsu, 2004) or in LBOs (Guo, Hotschkiss & Song, 2008; Katz, 2008), is their main asset. This reputation allows them to attract the best investment opportunities, to negotiate favourable terms with entrepreneurs (this can reach a 30% discount on the company valuation; Hsu, 2004) and to exit under favourable terms (Gompers & Xuan, 2008).

Fund managers can reduce the destructive impact of their activities and optimise the triple bottom line by:

* Exercising social and environmental due diligence aside from their other audits when they evaluate an investment opportunity (buyer due diligence).
* Setting measurement criteria to monitor these elements, as well as assessing the corporate culture of the company on a regular basis.
* Exercising exactly the same due diligence as at entry, when selling the company (vendor due diligence).

_Beyond words: the EDF private equity management tool_

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has set up and provided to the public5 an environmental, social and governance (ESG) management tool for private equity. Figure 7.1 provides the general framework, which is then broken down into 22 criteria. These criteria, once documented, allow fund managers to position the investment according to best practice and to follow the progression over time.

Footnote 5: www.edf.org/greenreturns.

Figures 7.2 and 7.3 then sum up the input and the results, which are used as a support for further action. This evaluation is a support to action and improvement for fund managers. Given their ability to develop new methods and monitoring tools, there is no reason why they cannot carry out this three-step procedure in record time.

It is up to the fund investors to impose these requirements when they commit to a fund. If a fund investor is excluded because it wants to integrate the triple bottom line with the evaluation of the fund's performance, it can leverage the reputation effect and weigh in to change this attitude (see Section 7.3). Foundations and insurance groups should logically be the first in line to put pressure on fund managers.

Do fund managers have the means to work on these issues? As they have a significant control on their portfolio companies (Kelleher, 2011), and as these companies are more flexible and adaptable than most of the large listed group, the answer is yes. Moreover, often enough, the dimensions which are highlighted in the EDF document are actually part of the value creation assessment which is done by fund managers at the time of investment (see Chapter 4).

The only obstacles which could prevent implementation are:

* setting up this monitoring, on top of the others, requires time, effort and money. Whether the investment will be recouped is a matter of documenting and communicating the results. Indeed, as a significant proportion of the value of portfolio companies is immaterial, documenting the human capital, the know-how, the expertise, the processes and other areas of the activity of the company can only help at exit time to optimise the value.

* The conflicting outcomes of a financial analysis (cost cutting, for example) and of the EDF assessment. The temptation would be to bypass the second element to give way to cost cutting. However, as the second assessment is also a long-term commitment, it might be that this conflict reveals a deeper concern about the strategy, the positioning and the overall assumptions on which the business is made. If reducing the number of employees conflicts with the EDF assessment in human management, it might be time to review the training policies, the insourcing/outsourcing approach of the company and other elements which actually influence the conflicting diagnostics.

### Philanthropy

_The fig leaf of philanthropy_

Philanthropy has been promoted to the rank of ethical proof of good behaviour. Many hedge and private market fund managers have been actively involved in the charity business, thus promoting their names and giving an appearance of morality to their activities. Not only are these actions done mainly in order to achieve self-promotion, sometimes aiming at the survival of a reputation beyond one's lifetime, but their impact is also far from being optimal.

Private and uncoordinated philanthropic actions can have disastrous consequences, notably because the needs of the population are rarely assessed locally but according to a grand scheme which is based on assumptions. It has been proven, for example, that private foundations which donate large amounts to specific medical research programmes are depriving other medical research areas of their brightest professionals, thus having an adverse selection effect. Moreover, many non-governmental agencies lack professionalism and efficiency, thereby reducing the value per dollar collected for or granted to them.

The contrast is especially strong between the reluctance of fund managers to pay taxes (a lingering debate since 2007 in the UK and the USA, notably about treating the carried interest as income tax-wise), which are used mainly to provide public services and support the more deprived population groups, and their over-exposed role in the philanthropic area. The cost of galas and charity fundraising events often looks obscene when compared to the practical result that these sums are generating.

_Venture philanthropy, social venturing, community venturing..._

'Social' or 'community' venture capital and'venture philanthropy' (see Balsham, Brown, Lee & Rubalevskaya, 2011) embrace an impressive set of initiatives. It is not the purpose here to criticise these efforts or their goals. However, it has to be noted very precisely that the borderline between high-risk/high-return for-profit activities on the one hand and low- or no-return activities on the other may not exist.

Private equity has built a powerful model (as seen in the previous six chapters) to generate profits and distribute them. This model is built on a strong alignment of interests between providers of capital (fund investors) and their agents (fund managers). To do so, corporate governance has been pushed forward, and incentives are used to motivate the staff (stock options) and to put pressure on them to succeed (financial leverage in the case of an LBO, remaining cash until the next milestone - and subsequent fundraising for ventures).

would this model be used for non-profit? First, alignments of interest are difficult to structure, because the providers of capital may have very different motivations for being involved in such social endeavour (recognition, reputation, involvement, religion, etc.). It is hence difficult to align them with the social venture which is financed as these goals are heterogeneous - and also difficult to measure.

Profit is rather easy to measure as there is a common standard for it. Measuring the impact of a social endeavour is much more difficult. How can one measure the reputation improvement associated with a social venture?

Incentives are even more difficult to put in place. First, because beyond the satisfaction of working on such a project, the outcome will be mostly immaterial and often not even distributable. Hence, the activity itself is the reward for the staff involved - but that does not guarantee efficiency and the best use of the resources provided.

_Name, shame and remember: the powerful leverage of reputation_

In other words, it is the responsibility of each fund manager to do what social or community investors do, without any doubt or exception. However, this should be the case for every single fund manager - social, philanthropic, community or any other 'classic' one.

Rejecting this statement is proof that the fund manager is itself a source of risk which is not mitigated - and cannot be by the fund investor itself in any way. As a matter of fact, negative externalities, whether environmental, social, reputational or any other, eventually form a backlash which is increasingly hitting the fund manager, but also its fund investors as well.

Pension funds as fund investors are very sensitive to these issues. For example, Cerberus Capital Management divested from Freedom Group after the Newton school shooting in 2012 under the pressure of its limited partners (among them CalSTRS). Freedom Group manufactured the weapon used to kill 28 people in an elementary school. The indirect share of CalSTRS in Freedom Group amounted to 2.4%. Although Cerberus put Freedom Group for sale 4 days after the shooting, there were no takers. CalSTRS voted to divest from firearms holdings in January 2013, but it was only in June 2015 that it could effectively divest from Freedom Group as Cerberus effectively created a twin fund to the existing one without the ownership of Freedom Group. The company ultimately went bankrupt in 2018.

As much as non-financial issues are concerned, it is hence reputations which are at the core of private markets. They are the leverage through which fund managers are motivated to act and take into account the context of their activity - much more than giving, pledging and rubbing shoulders with other socialites in evening gowns and black ties.

### Transparency

_The long march to greater transparency started in San Francisco_

In December 2002, the San Francisco Superior Court ruled (_Mercury News \(\nu\) CalPERS_) in favour of the application of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the private equity portfolio of CalPERS. The pension fund, followed by others in several American states, complied and published the individual performance of the private equity funds it invested in on a regular basis. This pressure in favour of transparency followed the initial disclosure of the private equity investments of Ross Perot in 1992 during the US Presidential election and later the Enron scandal (Chaplinsky, 2004).

The decision of the Court shed light on a very opaque sector: suddenly, the industry was no longer protected by a veil of confidentiality. One of the official concerns of the fund managers was the lack of general understanding about the performance, the J-curve phenomenon and the lack of liquidity of the asset class. This objection was quickly dismissed, as the press, which initiated the lawsuit, as well as the pension fund, are supposed to provide explanations about this performance.

_Track records and fees once the wave recedes: who batbed naked?_

Another issue was that any written communication between CalPERS and the fund managers should be disclosed - which could harm the portfolio companies of the funds issuing quarterly reports. However, some limits could be set for the disclosure in order to protect business secrets. In fact, CalPERS had only to disclose the performance of funds and possibly the fees collected by fund managers. The fact that CalPERS did not know until recently how much in fees was being collected by its fund managers generated some concern, highlighting knowledge gaps in such a large institution.

Fund investors reacted positively to this decision, which rebalanced the power between them and the fund managers by making the information more accessible. The industry suddenly realised that when it became an asset class, it was no longer able to keep parts of the most sensitive data secret from investors: fees and performance. Hence, it was possible not only to compare the performance of fund managers, but also to compare their valuation methods and to understand how they structured their fees.

What fund managers disliked was that it was now possible to further analyse their performance and compare their marketing pitch with the reality of the market. In particular, it was possible to ascertain the true contribution of funds to the success of their portfolio companies by benchmarking them with other funds of the same vintage.

As already discussed, reputation is important for fund managers. It is reputation which attracts the best opportunities, which enables fund managers to negotiate the terms of their investment and possibly get concessions from the other side and to obtain better exit conditions for their investments (Nahata, 2007). Reputation also supports their claims for management fees and carried interest. If the market becomes more transparent, investors will rely less on reputation and more on the facts. This also applies to entrepreneurs and managers.

_Consequences_

The consequences of disclosure were mixed. As there were more fund investors willing to enter the asset class than funds offered, existing fund investors had limited room left to negotiate a reduction of the fees and the carried interest. However, performance could be better analysed and the debate about the application of fair market value to the portfolios increased the analysis of unrealised performance.

Surprisingly, entrepreneurs were also better informed. It appeared that serial entrepreneurs were increasingly not so keen to work again with the same investors they had been working with before (Bengtsson, 2008). Entrepreneurs even started to share actively their knowledge about potential investors through initiatives such as TheFunded.com.

Transparency was therefore not a risk for their portfolio companies, but for the fund managers' own interests as agents. Even worse, the barriers to entry that they had built patiently through an existing track record (as opposed to a limited or no track record for new entrants) could suddenly be lowered dramatically by the fund investors' ability to obtain detailed means of comparison.

The movement towards transparency is still very much in development. Confidentiality will remain a necessary feature of private markets. Preserving business secrets, protecting innovation, maintaining some stability surrounding the investments: these factors are deemed to be preserved. Not only will transparency never be as complete as it could be for other asset classes, due notably to a necessary time lag and protection of underlying portfolio companies' business secrets; but also data itself does not replace the ability to interpret, confront and investigate this data so as to understand the true performance of fund managers. The goal of investors should be to reduce the asymmetry of information instead of targeting a higher quantity of data (_The Economist_, 2009).

### Self-regulation or imposed regulation?

_The case for active self-regulation_

On a broad scale, international self-regulation has to be at the core of fund managers' future action, even if that sounds rather optimistic. Not only because _national_ self-regulation no longer makes sense, given the international reach of venture capital and LBO fund managers; but also because they are diversifying their interventions. The fact that LBO fund managers are now setting up hedge funds, distressed debt funds, real-estate funds, advisory services, M&As and fund placement activities has created some conflicts of interest, notably in the way they handle the information they collect and how they exercise the rights attached to these activities.

Even if they were and still are far from being effective in investment banking, private equity groups need to set up very strong Chinese walls. If they are set up, there is very little chance of generating and exploiting synergies between the LBO and distressed debt businesses (_Financial Times_, 2007b), for example. The same applies to private equity houses which have developed real-estate practices alongside their LBO activity: information gathered could be used by different internal practices for purposes other than those for which it was gathered. The incentive for setting up rules is therefore very limited.

_Re-aligning interests: compensations, communication and valuation_

The second element is to take the initiative to set fairer terms and conditions as to the management of the funds. This means that the industry should publish standard management fees and carried interest terms. Management fees should be defined according to the real needs of the fund managers, and also to avoid any competition to increase the fund's size just to collect more fees. If not mandatory, these terms should at least be an indication of the market standard and define the reasoning behind it.

Then, the industry should settle for a specific fair but prudent accounting and valuation standard and stick to it. Not only is there no reason why this should not be accepted by the rest of the financial industry, but it could also replace the race towards mark-to-market valuations. As this asset class is successful and generating substantial returns, the refusal of the fair market value will not harm its success - notably because capital inflow is still high.

In that respect, the valuation standards have to be framed precisely by the industry. Unrealised profits should not be booked, despite SFAS 159, until realisation. In private equity, options are worth nothing until they are triggered, as investments are deemed to be made over the mid to long term and the value of these options remains subject to high uncertainty. This uncertainty introduces volatility in returns, and thus a risk, which is not compensated by potential returns for fund investors. The only benefit is for the agent (the fund manager), for fundraising purposes (flattering performance) and incentive calculation. That should be discarded as a reason to apply SFAS 159 (_Financial Times_, 2007a).

The guiding principle of decisions should always be to act in the best interest of the fund investors. The agent's mission is to manage the funds for them. The collective interest of the fund managers is therefore to be the protectors of the fund investors' interest. This guiding principle should be enforced by professional sanctions, such as a ban on private equity activity, with a published list of the subjects of these sanctions.

_Playing with the (stock exchange) fire: MBO on listed companies_

Even though the 'eclipse of the public corporation' has been announced (Jensen, 1989), private equity professionals should pay particular attention to the way they deal with stock exchange investors. First, because these shareholders are the potential buyers of their portfolio companies (either directly at IPO time, or indirectly through another listed company). Second, because regulations have focused increasingly on the protection of stock exchange investors. And finally, because an increasing proportion of these investors are also their limited partners.

When a public-to-private transaction occurs, it is in the interest of the LBO fund managers to make sure that they pay a fair price for the company they acquire. The logic behind this is that they not only have to take the opportunity into account, but also the long-term prospects of the company. When a company is delisted, operational improvements are difficult to generate. There is a high risk that the LBO manager will be accused of using only financial leverage and traditional financial engineering methods (associated with lay-offs).

The delisting of Kinder Morgan (USD 15.2 billion) is one example where the CEO of the company led the LBO of his own firm (Lashinsky, 2007), resulting in conflicts of interest despite the presence of the Board in the company. This was firstly because the initial offer was announced at USD 84.41 per share and then increased to USD 107.5. Rich Kinder stated in front of his Board that, after restructuring, the stock could reach USD 163 per share by 2010 (this was before the 2007 crisis).

With the LBO, the share of the CEO in the company jumped from 18% to 31% without any capital injection from his side. The fact that this offer went out without further announcement was a shock, and the CEO was criticised for his lack of transparency. Shareholders demanded that they benefit from the same conditions as the CEO in the planned LBO ('staple LBO'), without any success.

In this case, it is obvious that the managers were looking at their interests first, and the company advisors at theirs - and not at all at the interests of the shareholders. Interestingly, Kinder was trained in the corporate world at Enron, where shareholders' interests and management's interests did not converge. Kinder and his partners had all the information, whereas the independent Board had to rely on what was provided to them by the management (who were part of the offer). Because Kinder and his partners planned the operation and structured an investment syndicate 2 monthsbefore informing the Board, there was little chance that a competitive bid would succeed - especially when the management was part of the current public offer.

Even worse, 20% of the profits from selling the group or listing it again went to the management (and 40% of that 20% to Rich Kinder himself). The debt of the LBO would have been paid with asset disposals, and the final reward would have come to a further IPO... at a much higher price.

Public anger is mounting against such practices (Stein, 2006). There is little that minority individual shareholders can do against a take-private LBO. The power of these shareholders is especially limited, as the managers of the companies are in full control of these operations. One of the conclusions is that the managers of a listed company should be excluded legally from any operation involving a take-private with a 5 to 10-year period of exclusion, so as to avoid such blatant conflicts of interest and misappropriation of latent profits. According to Stein, this is a major source of insider trading in the sense that the management uses the information for its own benefit at the expense of the stockholders.

### Conclusion

Whether fund investors like it or not, private equity will remain a sector with small areas of transparency and large parts of the business obscured by confidentiality. Paradoxically, this is actually very good news. Transparency will force fund managers to constantly prove their value and continue to innovate in order to support their portfolio companies. Innovation in financial services is a way to distinguish and thus avoid the systematic application of a benchmark.

Confidentiality will keep fund investors on their toes and applying their judgement constantly, exercising their responsibilities and avoiding the outsourcing of their risk management - which was a major source of problems in the recent crisis (Blankfein, 2009). In that respect, rating agencies' reports on leveraged loans are only a small element in evaluating the health of LBO deals.

The alignment of interests is not only a matter of working in favour of the investors without favouring the agent's interest, but also working actively to achieve the best result possible for the ultimate beneficiaries - that is to say, the public who will eventually retire, need insurance cover, who own shares in listed companies, etc. Fund investors also have to align their interests with their own investors. This means that they have to assess precisely their risk-return profile for their private equity investments; they have to obtain the best insider knowledge in private equity; they have to negotiate the terms and conditions systematically to get the best terms possible and they have to act immediately once they have invested.

Surprisingly, the rewards for being a good fund investor are meagre. Compared to the lavish fees and carried interest, an endowment manager, an insurance executive or a pension fund representative has low incentives to maximise the use of its risk margins, to maximise their net returns by negotiating the terms and to proactively manage their portfolio of funds. Even very successful endowment managers, such as a former Harvard endowment head of investment, raise a public outcry when they are fairly compensated for their value creation.

It is no wonder that trustees or asset managers are tempted to collude with fund managers. It is difficult to justify such a discrepancy in compensation for jobs which are closely related, and for expertise which is rare and valuable on the market.

The result is that some fund investors' representatives are not qualified to invest and monitor private equity fund investments; or prepare their next move to either join one of the fund managers or to join/create a gatekeeper/fund of funds; or collude with the fund managers they are supposed to control.

In a complex market, when transparency and confidentiality are being combined, there should be a constant preoccupation to involve every actor in the market in a controlling role over other players, without any direct negative or positive individual impact if they have to punish bad behaviour. Everyone should therefore be a potential whistleblower. Setting up a system of checks and balances in the market, with the agreement of the main actors, is what fund investors and managers should be aiming to achieve.

for emerging managers. These two factors reduce the incentive to innovate in terms of investment strategies. As there are usually 'grandfather rights' for installed fund managers, they benefit from an advantage - even if they are not necessarily the most efficient investors. Notably, some fund managers that have built a brand thanks to attractive past track records, but which are not necessarily relevant, could still gather the interest of fund investors who are not necessarily aware of these elements and base their analysis on quantitative elements.

Second, fund managers can leverage their brand to launch these new strategies, and fund investors have a financial and reputational incentive to invest with these large, established and known fund managers.

Third, the founders of fund managers have to manage their succession, having created their structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Though they could pass them on to the new generation, the temptation is to realise the wealth created by simply selling the structure.

The main challenge that private markets have to face in the short term is to offer better risk management instruments (see Section 8.2) to fund investors. Even though there is no indicator offering a single and direct reading risk measurement, assessing the fund managers' aptitude to think over the long term is crucial (see Section 8.3). Risk management can ignite a flow of initiatives towards financial innovation, but also bring some changes in the presentation of results (see Section 8.4), which could have a considerable negative impact on private markets (see Section 8.5). In that respect, private markets are at a crossroads: increased knowledge of the asset class can provide fund investors with more options (see Section 8.6), but could also transform the asset class into an overly regulated sector - which is a lose-lose scenario.

### Provide better instruments for risk measurement

The limited tradability of private assets is an intrinsic component of private markets investing. Investors have to define a time horizon for their investments. If they cannot stay invested 3 to 8 years on average, depending on the strategy, then there is no point in investing in private markets. In that respect, the time to liquidity (or duration for direct lending strategies) is a dimension of investing, not a risk.

Risks in private markets are difficult to manage, as they cannot be reduced to one figure. At least five measures of risk have been identified by Demaria and He (2019). The investment strategy risk measures the variation of the aggregate performance of private market funds, by vintage year, over time. This top-down perspective is useful for portfolio construction and to assess the probability of a loss, and the amounts lost in case of a loss. The fund investment risk provides the frequency at which funds of a given private market strategy lose or make money, and the amount lost or gained. This top-down approach is also close in philosophy to the value-at-risk, and works well with fully liquidated funds.

Active funds risk measurement compares the quarter-on-quarter evolution of the performance of active funds of a given private markets strategy with the average performance of fully realised funds. The fund selection risk is a bottom-up approach, which measures the ability of the fund investor to select good funds. Finally, it is possible to quantify the variation around the average time to liquidity of a given private markets strategy, which effectively would be some form of 'liquidity risk' measurement.

These instruments are new and have the advantage of being replicable with listed assets. They might provide a convergence point when building portfolios mixing different assets.

Nevertheless, measuring risk remains difficult as these risks are at the same time endogenous and exogenous to private markets. Exogenous because for example private equity performance is correlated - up to a certain level - with the performance of the listed markets. Financial markets condition portfolio companies' exits, either through sale on a stock exchange, or a trade sale to a strategic acquire. This acquirer can be listed. In that case, its price per share and the value of its bonds (and hence the interest rates) will determine its aptitude to make acquisitions. If the acquirer is not listed, it is the interest rates (and hence the overall economic climate) which will determine the aptitude of a non-listed group to make acquisitions. These two exit cases voluntarily ignore an acquisition strategy fully financed by the cash reserves of the strategic acquirer. This could indicate that the debt is too expensive (and that interest rates are too high, as the economic context is not favourable to acquisitions). The valuation of a portfolio company will thus be realised thanks to the listed comparable method and will be _in fine_ linked to market conditions.

Endogenous because multiple factors are specific to private markets:

* _The difficulty for fund managers to reproduce the performance from one fund to another._ The performance of a fund is related to its investments, which are decisions taken according to the circumstances as much as a rational and rigorous process. Personal chemistry is a key component, which is neither quantifiable nor can bereduced to a technical process. Success calls for greater progress in that respect (reputation effect, see Chapter 7).

However, _past performance does not give any indication of future performance_ in most cases (Gottschalg & Kreuter, 2007). Funds of funds illustrate this statement abundantly, despite the consistency of performance of private equity funds (Kaplan & Schoar, 2003). Funds of funds have an investment policy which backs the established names of private equity, despite mediocre performance. They perceive it as less risky than backing emerging and innovating teams. _Funds of funds are thus partially contributing to market inertia instead of correcting it_, and create a lagging effect which is prejudicial to private markets. The Yale endowment provides a different example, having established best practice in terms of portfolio performance and selection of emerging teams (Lerner, Schoar & Wang, 2008).
* _The rapid evolution of private markets._ Notably, the strong democratisation of technologies in the venture capital area and the increasing competition between the different funds over investing in the companies which fit their investment model best. This generates uncertainty about the performance of teams which have set up their strategy at a given time and are prepared to deploy the capital in a market evolving quickly over the course of the next 5 years (the length of a fund investment period).

This is why selection is made primarily on the fund offering, but through an _evaluation of the fund managers_. They have built a reputation over time, and have the capacity to identify attractive opportunities, negotiate investments, manage portfolio companies and prepare investment exits.

Top private equity fund managers work for the long term. Not only do they nurture portfolio companies, but they also _nurture future opportunities_. LBO fund managers approach potential sellers sometimes 18 to 30 months before effectively acquiring a company. They also develop a _network_ patiently in order to attract opportunities that could fit their investment strategy. This is the case with venture capital, for example, where fund managers maintain contact with CEOs of their former portfolio companies. These CEOs not only recommend other opportunities, but can also launch new ventures themselves which might be of interest to venture capital investors.

One of the ways to reduce the volatility of performance lies in the capacity of the fund managers to build a network and to 'industrialise' their know-how, notably by waiting patiently for the right opportunity. Evaluating this wealth of future opportunities, for a fund investor, is paramount. To do so, fund investors need to immerse themselves in the environment of the fund managers. They have to get feedback from intermediaries, former CEOs of companies, former employees and any stakeholder that the fund manager had to interact with. _Frank and honest feedback_ on the capacities and personalities of the fund managers is worth a lot of data crunching.

Another approach is to look at the _performance of the portfolio companies once they have been listed or sold to strategic acquireers_(Cao & Lerner, 2009). Have they survived this event? How did they perform? Were they gifted with the capacity to develop harmoniously? This also reveals the capacity of general partners to really create value, but even more importantly, it proves that they are able to _think over the long term_.

### The only valid identity: long-term thinking

The fact that _an entire generation of fund managers is going to retire_ in the upcoming years highlights the importance of this _long-term thinking process_: how will they handle this generational shift? Did they nurture talents that are able to take over the management of the fund manager? Did they train them adequately to face the upcoming challenges, including handling future performance?

In the future, performance figures will probably evolve downwards - as well as the risk associated with investing. If valuations can suffer from a drop in the near or mid term, over the long term, the trend could evolve differently, and notably towards increasing values. This is due to a capital inflow, as private markets become increasingly popular (see Section 8.4), which will drive down the marginal returns of investments. A downward performance trend has already been witnessed in the venture capital industry in the USA, which is the sign of a maturing sector. Large and mega LBOs in the USA are also following the same path. This trend will probably develop and apply gradually to each segment of private markets.

Fund investors, aware of this challenge, are overly conscious of the difficulty of selecting the fund managers they want to work with. At the same time, they want to limit the costs involved in investing in this asset class. This exercise is difficult, as fees and costs remain relatively stable over time.

### The impact of fair market value

In accounting, under the pressure of the new solvency and prudential ratios to be applied by institutional investors, fair market value has been promoted as a way of better pricing assets. These norms rely on reasoning methods which merely use analogies and market data, if it is available. Not only does this increase the volatility of performance, it also reinforces the habit of comparing listed stock prices with private share values - which is a wrong assessment, as explained in Chapter 4.

However, these norms (the FAS 157 accounting rules) appear to have encouraged financial volatility and have not, so far, brought the expected results as to the valuation of private equity portfolios. According to FAS 157, the value of portfolio companies must be reflected in a calculated equivalent of a market price. This _evaluation_ is related not only to their _intrinsic performance compared to budget_, but also to their _comparables listed on the stock exchange_. This could contribute to changing substantially the value of private market portfolios and generating arbitrages from fund investors who have to manage their portfolio with regard to their balance sheet and their net result. This _negates the specificity of private equity_, that is to say the long-term commitment of fund investors and managers.

_The volatility of private equity performance increases the costs of capital for fund investors._ In finance, volatility equates to risks, and risks have to be covered partially or totally with cash or cash equivalents. By introducing volatility in private equity evaluations, the _FAS 157 accounting standards have increased the cost of investing in small and medium-sized businesses_. As fund investors are involved for the long term, and asthe volatility of private equity performance will remain high with FAS 157 (at least more than with the historical costs method, which was prevailing until then), the impact will be durably high.

As mentioned throughout this book, private markets do not obey the same laws as listed markets. Furthermore, the sector is emerging slowly as an asset class, with some identified patterns and historical data which - even though imperfect - can be exploited statistically. The imperfections of private market statistics in that respect are far less damaging for the economy as a whole than FAS 157 as such. Not only does most private markets activity struggle to find acceptable listed comparables, but it is also against all sound reasoning to apply this method continuously - that is to say, when companies are not actively being put up for sale. Even worse, _FAS 157 represents a reverse of the history of private equity and the eclipse of public corporations_(Jensen, 1989).

_Fund of funds managers have been deafeningly silent in the debate_, even though statistically it appears to decrease the risk associated with private markets investing (Weidig & Mathonet, 2004). This once again _raises concerns as to their utility in the industry if they do not build their case_. They currently seem to focus more on reducing fees by bundling fund and co-investment, and selling the package to fund investors.

Interestingly, large and mega buy-out fund managers were voicing their support for fair market value in December 2003 through the Private Equity Industry Guidance Group (PEIGG). This was before the crisis; the PEIGG pressed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) to use it - and the NVCA finally endorsed it. Since 2008, fund managers such as Blackstone, who were initially promoting the rules, are complaining about their application - after the impact of the financial crisis had depressed the valuation of listed companies. This sheds an interesting light on the endorsement by those same groups, this time through the Private Equity Council,1 created in 2006, of 'guidelines for responsible investments'.

Footnote 1: Renamed the Private Equity Growth Capital Council in 2010, even though it essentially represented LBO funds, and after that the American Investment Council in 2016.

There is no obvious solution to the problem that is raised by fair market value, except asking for an exemption from FAS 157 for private markets - with the exception of large and mega buy-outs. KPMG (2009) states that 'the fair [value] accounting rules should also be reassessed to distinguish between those that accurately reflect economic value destruction and those that unnecessarily precipitate actions that serve to exaggerate economic loss'.

Fund investors could thus use this partial application of fair market value to large and mega buy-out funds in order to set up their own valuation framework so as to determine the value of the funds in which they have invested. This could be slowed down by the difficulties of obtaining access to the underlying data and the details of portfolio companies with certain fund managers.

### A long-term trend: the attractiveness of private markets

The risk-return profile of private markets will remain attractive, which means that capital inflow should last (see Figure 8.2). Pregin estimates that assets under management in private equity have reached USD 3.4 trillion as of 2018 (USD 5.9 trillion for private markets) and should reach USD 4.9 trillion in 2023 (USD 9.3 trillion for private markets). This has to be put in perspective: alternative investments should reach USD 14 trillion, a 59% increase compared to 2017 (USD 8.8 trillion). Investors are expected to come more from Asia-Pacific. Public and private pension funds are expected to be more active in private markets, as well as endowments and foundations, sovereign wealth funds and family offices (Preqin, 2018). According to Ford (2019), quoting Willis Towers Watson, institutional investors have allocated 14% of their assets to private markets and this is expected to reach 20% over the next 10 years.

However, that would mean overcoming the main hurdles that fund investors mention with regard to their commitment to alternative assets (see Table 8.1). In any case, the transition from a traditional asset allocation to a more diversified and return-oriented allocation, integrating private equity, should be very progressive as illustrated in Figure 8.2, except in the case of sovereign wealth funds. The latter are unconstrained investors, in the sense that they are free to allocate their assets without any regulation to comply with. According to JP Morgan, the asset allocation shifts are planned to be realised over an average period of 3.4 years.

Progressive deployment of capital in private markets is a blessing. Economies can only absorb so much of the capital available and transform it into profitable investments. If there is an excess over this capacity of absorption, then valuations increase and returns are affected. As private equity is first and foremost an activity based on human interactions, networks and activity tend to be local (except in large and mega LBOs). It takes time and effort to deploy the capital efficiently in a market dominated

Figure 8.2: Allocation to private equity, by investor type (excluding funds of funds)

by inefficiencies and asymmetry of information. The overall performance of the sector is hence dependent on the quality of the investment teams.

The relative immaturity of private markets in emerging markets should raise caution when they become unduly fashionable, or not. The notion of moderate and managed growth of private markets appears as a clear determinant of the future of this asset class: the economy can only absorb a certain volume of capital. Excesses are clearly visible, in venture capital (1999-2001, see Figure 8.3) and in LBOs (2007-2010).

According to Figure 8.3, the venture capital sector has attracted less capital since the bubble burst of 2001-2003, and the levels of fundraising have been significantly lower than the previous cycle. Fund investors have moreover focused their commitments on fewer teams, raising more money (with the consequences explored in Section 4.1: funding gaps in seed and early-stage rounds, higher valuations as fund managers chase the same deals and want to deploy a larger amount of money per company). According to Partners Group, LBOs followed the same path. Fund managers will raise more capital, and valuations shifted depending on the type of deals and the number of bidders. Large and mega LBOs in the USA were the most affected.

_Cultural, economic, social and legal factors_

Fund investors are the ones making the market, collectively. Their motivations to invest in private markets vary depending on which country is considered, but also their characteristics. As explained by Demaria (2015), fund investors are 'irrational investors subject to biases' such as fashion, fads, representativeness bias, aversion to ambiguity, under-reaction to information, sensitiveness to noise and reputation, home investing bias, over-confidence and fit into prospect theory. The determinants of fund investors' behaviour are asset allocation policies, investment decision guidelines and processes, recruitment and incentive policies, profiles and tenure of staff, network and integration

\end{table}
Table 8.1: Main advantages, drawbacks and hurdles of alternative investmentsin the fund investors' community, as well as reputation as a fund investor. However, these elements depend first and foremost on the size of the investor, which determines the total capital currently deployed in private markets. This in turn conditions know-how and experience, which is a function of the time spent in the asset class and the network built by the fund investor.

Depending on the commitment, the investment activity will evolve significantly and hence dramatically affect the private markets and economic landscape. Cultural, economic, social and legal factors are also involved in the development of private markets. A long-term convergence of the US and European private markets is expected

(and later of emerging markets). The whole economy favours this convergence, notably to manage the generational change at the helm of companies in developed economies. The opportunities are numerous, due mainly to market imperfections.

### Private equity: future victim of its own success?

Beyond the risk of bubbles, is the main risk facing the private equity sector its _commoditisation_(Lewis, 2006) in the short or medium term?

In 2005, Morgan Stanley stated that one-third of the initial public offerings over the course of 2003-2005 were of companies backed by private equity funds (half of them in 2005). Private equity funds were involved in one-quarter of M&As, and issued half of leveraged debt. This proportion increased to 30% of M&As in 2011. As of 31 December 2011, the amounts under management allocated to private equity represented EUR 1700 billion, that is to say 100 times more than 15 years ago. As of 2018, it doubled and reached EUR 3.4 trillion (see above). This represents 4.7% of the calculated total market capitalisation of listed companies worldwide. In 2017, USD 2.4 trillion was raised privately in the USA, to be compared with USD 2.1 trillion on listed markets, according to the _Wall Street Journal_.2 Private markets financing took over from public markets in 2011.

Footnote 2: Eaglesham, J. and Coulter, J., ’The fuel powering corporate America: USD 2.4 trillion private fundraising’, _The Wall Street Journal_, 2 April 2018.

However, _the impact of private equity may be under-estimated_. As a matter of fact, the total market for capitalisation of listed companies worldwide is an extrapolation of the price of their shares traded on the market. This means that if the total of the capital of a given company had to be sold on a specific day, the price of its shares would be dramatically different from its marginal price on a given day. In other words, the total to be allocated to private equity is a firm commitment, whereas the total value of all listed companies worldwide is just an extrapolation which would differ substantially as it has to be totally liquid from one day to the next.

This conclusion provides an interesting perspective on the application of fair market value. As illustrated over the course of this book, private equity fund managers have to produce reports valuing their assets as if they were to be sold the very next day. To do so, the recommendation is to use the value of comparable listed companies. However, these listed companies, if they had to be totally liquid the next day, would probably see their value drop dramatically (as happens in the case of market crashes).

In that respect, _the fair market value rule is just a complete nonsense_. Instead of taking the impact of time and the horizon of placement of each financial instrument into account, its promoters decided to adopt a rule which would free them from very difficult issues, despite the fact that it does not make any economic or financial sense. They became dazzled by the public market illusion: permanent and efficient pricing. This is a myth, but nevertheless, the rules of accounting are based on it. Sensible accounting rules would favour long-term investments, which are correlative to value creation. This is what accounting rules are supposed to measure and capture.

One of the most visible proofs of the fact that private markets should be considered as a specific asset class, with its own rules, is the emergence of a specific ecosystem. The development of secondary LBOs shows that private equity can acquire the logic of industrial growth. Theoretically, each fund brings its contribution to the growth of a company. For example, the French company Frans Bonhomme has been the target of four successive LBOs: in 1993, when it was bought by PPM Ventures from Bollore for EUR 150 million; then, it was acquired by Apax in 2000, for EUR 400 million; by Cinven for EUR 520 million in 2003; before being sold in 2005 to Apax for EUR 900 million. EBITDA was respectively EUR 25, 43, 65 and 90 million (L'Agefi, 2005). Secondary LBOs are now the second exit path for LBO funds, and represent 30-40% of the total of LBOs.

Capital inflow in private markets will have positive consequences if this means that all the segments of financing receive money, and this money is invested regularly (which lowers the cyclicity of the sector). The market imperfections and lack of transparency will probably allow some actors to stay in traditional private equity markets, such as technological venture capital. However, the inflow of capital raises some concerns as to the consistency of performance over the long term, if all else remains equal.

Many funds will see their performance change, and the next crisis will act as a reality check in that respect. In the future, investors' allocation to private markets should include - for diversification and return enhancement purposes - segments such as non-IT venture capital, growth capital and turn-around capital, which are still under-developed. This opens up investment perspectives, but requires the appropriate environment and risk appetite. Will private market funds duplicate listed markets, but without the regulatory burden associated with the latter category, to execute the transformation which is necessary for certain companies? This would create a "breathing space' for stock exchanges by creating a second 'economic and financial lung' for the economy, but would also raise many questions in terms of economic and financial governance. Many 'activist investors' in listed companies would like to introduce the methods which have been successful in portfolio companies of LBO funds (see Figure 8.4). However, the result of this action is visible only after a certain number of years, which makes it difficult to apply as such on listed markets.

This would require a certain evolution in the management of listed companies. These managers are not necessarily favouring these LBO methods, which involve a great deal of pressure and stress in their operation. It would not only be the responsibility of institutional investors to act in favour of an application of private equity methods (_Financial Times_, 2005), but also be in their interest (see Section 8.7).

The commoditisation of private equity would probably open the way to a new wave of innovation, but also a higher risk associated with it - if applying LBO techniques for example to different companies (riskier or more regulated). There is a limit to what private equity can do, given the constraints applied to funds. Moreover, the diffusion of private equity practices could lead to bad behaviour, most notably in the management of conflicts of interest, but also more failed high-profile operations such as Toys 'R Us which led a profitable company intro bankruptcy and massive layoffs.

The brief emergence of funds without management fees after the crisis of 2007-2009 reignited a long-standing debate: the reduction of the fees associated with private markets fund management. If high management fees have a meaning when it is necessary to set up a team and processes, and to comply with increased regulations,it is in the same way logical that fund investors are rewarded for the risk taken when backing these teams. It would also be logical that fund investors of a given fund have a priority investment right for the subsequent funds raised by a fund manager that they backed when the latter started its business.

These issues, as well as the governance of private market funds, will nurture numerous debates over the coming years. This is the consequence of the success of private equity as an asset class, as well as its internationalisation. Generally, this internationalisation is good for each local economy. For a start, it brings capital and talent to local markets, creating the basis for the development of local private market managers. Then,

Figure 4: Consequences of the crisis on the improvement of the performance and sales of portfolio companies under LBOs

and the \(\eta\)-dependent \(\eta\)coincides with a certain level of maturity of the portfolio. It provides an indication of which portfolio companies will survive or not, and their performance against budget in particular. This period corresponds to the real risk taken by private market fund investors. This is where the risk is the highest, as well as the return potential.
2. The second period, which is the time from the bottom of the J-curve to the break-even point of the fund. The risk associated with this period is the time to break even and the return potential. However, theoretically there is a good picture of the portfolio structure, the generation of performance through early exits and the expectations of the general partner. Here, the fund investor can expect a premium if it has to sell its stake in funds, owing to cash constraints or rebalancing. Even though it is not advisable as this would sever the relationship with the fund manager, some fund investors could exit from funds because of strategic allocation constraints.
3. The third period, which is the time from break-even to the total exit from the fund (e.g., full liquidity) is actually a matter of cash flow management and exit management. The risk is somewhat limited. The question is the time required to reach liquidity rather than the level of return, which can usually be assessed more or less precisely.

Through this analysis, combined with private equity statistics and macro-economic assessments, it is possible to oversee increasing sources of liquidity at the fund investor level. These sources do not necessarily imply cutting the relationships with the fund manager, but structuring products with specialised intermediaries as seen below.

#### 8.7.2 Innovating through Structuring

Finance and private equity are very innovative sectors. As innovation in the financial sector cannot be patented, there is a strong incentive to stay ahead of the competition by continuously finding new products and services to sell. Once the innovation is introduced on the market, the innovator's brand can maintain a relative advantage before the competition replicates the innovation. As the innovation is duplicated, it becomes mainstream and competition is increasingly placed on pricing. The product or service becomes a low-margin offer, which stimulates further innovation.

One of the elements that characterises _private equity_ is that its _'frontiers' are known_. _Tradability_ is one of them. It is not a problem at the fund level, but at the fund investor level, and can produce some _cash management difficulties_. Fund investors have to keep cash at hand to face upcoming capital calls. At the same time, they can receive distributions from divestments at any time. Cash usually should not stay idle at the fund investor level, as it is used to generate interest or profit.

It is possible that the fund investor cannot face some capital calls owing to a short-term cash need. In that case, the fund investor may be tempted to either sell its stake on the _secondary market_, with the consequence that it may lose part of the value of the asset (secondary discount) and probably also lose its relationship with the fund manager. To avoid these consequences, it is possible to _structure financial products_.

One way is to evaluate the potential of a given portfolio in terms of future liquidity and profit potential, and then _securities_ the portfolio according to certain criteria. The structured product will combine multiple tranches of debt (as is done in an LBO deal) and an equity part which will remain on the books of the fund investors. These securities will then be sold to other investors according to the risk associated with them. This solution, despite its cost, presents the advantage of generating immediate liquidity without severing the relationship with the fund manager.

Even though the 2007-2009 financial crisis has slowed down the growth of such structured products, they are still in _great demand_. Once _transparency_ has increased as for _underlying portfolios_, these products will be easier to structure and the costs of structuring will decrease. The frontiers of liquidity will be expanded for fund investors.

Another _frontier_ is the declared _decline of private equity returns_ in the mid to long term. Here again, structuring can help. Statistically, the risk of the default of a portfolio of private equity funds created according to the industry standards is 1% (Weidig & Mathonet, 2004). This means that fund investors can _leverage their portfolios_. So far, the guarantee for the debt is still difficult to evaluate, but as the asset class is increasingly known, lenders will be more willing to consider private market funds as an acceptable collateral to the debt. Fund investors can use this debt to further commit to funds and hence get the spread between the interest paid to the bank and the returns generated by the underlying funds (assuming there is one). The risk for the fund investors would thus increase in case of under-performance of private market funds.

#### 8.7.3 The Temptation of Co-investments

Among the emerging trends in private equity, co-investing has gained significant momentum (Stewart, 2012). According to Preqin (2012), 43% of fund investors actively sought co-investment rights when committing to funds (and a further 11%considered such opportunities). As a result, the amounts invested through co-investment jumped from USD 40-50 billion in 2012-2013 to USD 100-110 billion in 2016-2017 according to McKinsey. As a matter of comparison, direct investments remained constant at USD 10-20 billion over the period 2012-2017.

Fund of funds managers account for the largest proportion of the co-investor universe (23%), not surprisingly, as this enables them to reduce the impact of their own fees on the returns provided to their own investors (they reserve on average 14% of their funds of funds for direct deals, and 9% for secondaries). Family offices come next (Collins, 2012), having increased their direct allocations to private equity and real estate.

Originally, co-investments were offered to fund investors because the size of certain operations prevented some funds from acquiring the company while maintaining their optimal level of diversification (Meads & Davies, 2011). Preqin (2012) observed that 66% of LPs with co-investment interest have over USD 250 million allocated to the asset class, and a significant 13% had a private allocation in excess of USD 5 billion. Therefore, opportunities were first proposed to the largest fund investors and then to investors negotiating with sufficiently strong arguments. They are now institutionalised and open to fund investors committing a defined minimum amount to the fund, who can co-invest up to their allocation and usually for a fee and carried interest. 61% of fund investors explain that co-investments are done at the expense of their fund allocation (39% have a separate allocation) and 63% co-invest alongside fund managers on an opportunistic basis.

The motivations to co-invest include better returns (51% of respondents) and lower fees (35%). Other reasons include further diversification of their portfolio, better transparency, better alignment of interests with fund managers and attractive opportunities. For family offices, it is privacy, control and customisation.

However, this strategy implies risk. For fund managers, it creates a certain level of uncertainty. First, when the deals are negotiated, fund investors might lack resources and time to do their due diligence and approve the investment in time. Then, fund investors are not necessarily able to actively participate in the investment, create value and provide the know-how that a fund manager does. Nevertheless, fund managers have to accommodate their fund investors as co-investors, and they might diverge on the options to adopt for the portfolio company.

Then, as the deals offered to co-investments are larger, they also present specific risks: more competition (hence higher valuation, hence potentially lower profits), and maybe less value creation potential. The other risk is the 'adverse selection' (Murray, 2012) associated with this strategy: a fund manager will offer as co-investment the operations that it will not be able to finance alone or that it wants to syndicate - and they might be the ones which are not going to be the 'homeruns'.

Moseley (2011) has listed the main risks that fund investors take while investing directly in companies alongside fund managers:

* Co-investing and fund investing require different sets of skills. Due diligence is compressed into a few weeks for direct investments, and can span several months for fund due diligence. The competences at stake once invested are also very different.
* Fund managers invest with a specific framework, differing from that of fund investors. The nature of the investor dictates its due diligence and the responsibilities that it will take after investing.

* Fund investors are directly exposed in co-investing. No specific treatment is undertaken (timing, pricing, etc.) and the minority shareholders' rights have to be negotiated carefully.
* Co-investing cannot replace a private markets programme, unless the fund investor wants to become the equivalent of a captive fund manager.
* There is no perfect deal, and losses are part of the risks associated with direct investing.
* Diversification rules apply in co-investing. This means that it should be a regular activity, with a reasoned programme to deploy a certain pool of capital.

To illustrate the extent of what co-investment means, one has to consider what happened to SPACs or to pledge funds (or deal-by-deal funds). Funds structured around a specific deal run the risk of pushing fund managers to do a deal not because of the potential, but because of the compensation attached to it (hence multiplying the adverse selection associated with it). Then, once the deals are done, there is no mutualisation of profits or losses. If it is a loss, the fund investor receives all of it. If it is a gain, it receives the profit minus the success fee of the fund manager.

If the fund investor is not the sole investor in a given pledge fund, it means that delays in reaching a decision by other fund investors are also creating additional risks - as well as a disagreement on investment and hence a failed operation due to a total capital below the amount necessary to do the deal.

#### 8.7.4 Change or Die: The Pressure on Fund Managers

If private markets are an innovative financial sector, there is an area where changes have barely been made: the structure and level of fees. One of the reasons for this is related to the bargaining power of a fund manager, which writes the regulation of the fund, and negotiates it with each fund investor on a one-to-one basis. It is difficult for a fund investor to evaluate its capacity to negotiate lower fees, as it takes the risk of seeing the fund manager exclude it from the fundraising. However, the level of fees lowers the net results of the fund investors substantially, down to the point that at portfolio level, the risk-return profile of private market investments remains difficult to defend. The controversy has yet to be resolved over the ability of private markets to deliver substantial and consistent outperformance compared to traditional listed markets. However, there is a need to change the incentive structure of the private equity agent: the fund manager.

So far, some investors have adopted a very specific approach, by acquiring stakes in the fund manager itself. Thanks to this acquisition, they gain access to the finances of the fund manager and theoretically get back a portion of the fees that they pay to it, without introducing any damaging change into the traditional fee structure. These changes would apply to the entire fund investors' universe, as the'most favoured nation clause' usually included in a fund's regulation is inapplicable. This clause states that fund investors get the best treatment granted to any investor in the fund automatically (this includes any side agreement). As the fund manager is concerned specifically, stake sales are out of scope.

By taking a stake in the fund managers, both investors and fund managers have defused immediate criticism about the cost to the final beneficiaries of the assets managed by investors. However, this attitude can only be a short-term approach. It is in the the best interest of investors to generalise a significant decrease in fees collected by private market fund managers, notably those which are above EUR 250 million (the management fees of which are usually sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the fund manager). Not only are investors not systematically shareholders of the managers of the funds they invest in, but also overall, these fees are rippling through the entire financial market to the benefit of the fund manager. They set an example where other asset classes try to replicate their fee structure, and also create 'free options' for fund managers when markets are just going up.

Many suggestions have been made for decreasing the level of fees paid to the fund manager, notably by setting up a full (or more interestingly partial) fee offset mechanism where any income generated by the fund manager - aside from its management fee - would be repaid to the fund and compensate the other expenses it bears. The incentive for the fund manager to generate this side income would thus be limited in the case of a full fee offset mechanism. Neverthless, according to MJ Hudson, fee offset mechanisms are now almost systematically implemented in fund regulations.

Once the management fees are adjusted to pay only the fixed costs, the carried interest mechanism has to be reviewed. Whether we like it or not, fair market value has introduced listed markets as a competitor for asset allocation. It is thus necessary to set a benchmark deal by deal, which evolves according to the behaviour of the market - and gives the fund manager an incentive to generate systematically the return expected by the fund investors.

This debate examines the true perspectives of investing in small and medium-sized companies from afar, but it is revealing of the incentives, the motivation and the ethics of private market investors. It is difficult to convince the public and the regulators that fund managers pursue capital gains through value creation when, like Steven Schwarzman, they are paid more than USD 2.3 million in salary, but overall USD 700 million in stocks received through the vesting of 25% of the equity granted from the listing of The Blackstone Group. That made him the best-paid CEO of 2008 (Lattman, 2009), despite the crash in the value of the company which was only listed in 2007 (see Figure 8.6).

Given the media and public attention focused on hedge funds and private equity remuneration, it is only a matter of time before the profession will have to change. The question is mainly: will it do so voluntarily and sufficiently so as to appease the public, or will it be under regulatory pressure? The fact that pension funds have to disclose their private equity portfolio will act as a monitoring window for public scrutiny.

#### Regulation: Damocies' Sword Looming over Private Markets

Private markets remain vulnerable to rapid and strong changes. The application of the Basel III Agreements and the 'Volcker rule' by banks have led to a significant decrease in their exposure to the private equity asset class. Banks were not ready to face the strong increase in capital costs that represents their direct involvement in the asset class. Because of the banks' prudential ratios, lending and investment conditions have recently been made more stringent for small and medium-sized businesses. This could be reversed in case of amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act, as pondered in the USA at the time of writing.

Regulatory evolution is not limited to banks: insurance companies have also been affected in their ability to finance small businesses through capital injection by the application of the European Directive 'Solvency II'. The retreat of banks will be difficult to compensate. If confirmed, the insurers' relative disaffection would be even more difficult to absorb in Europe, as they account for a fair share of sources of capital for private market funds in Europe.

Even though regulation has been favourable to private equity in the past, given its positive impact on emerging, small and medium-sized businesses, its reputation has changed notably because of large and mega LBO operations and the levels of remuneration of the fund managers doing these deals.

The first warning came with the 'asset stripping' strategy at the end of the 1980s in the USA. LBO fund managers were acquiring companies in order to reduce their overheads and restructured them heavily. The social consequences of these practices were important, because their social fluidity is meagre compared to their financial fluidity. The reputation of the general partners, described as 'Barbarians', suffered and they had to build a different image in order to avoid the intervention of the regulator.

This time, pressure has increased in the USA and also in Europe, and especially in the UK and Germany. These countries have reacted strongly against the remuneration levels of large/mega LBO fund managers and the tax treatment of these remuneration (which are low as to capital gains). Multiple projects for regulation have emerged, notably in the USA and the UK, to change the tax treatment of carried interest. The USA has introduced a mandatory registration of fund managers with the regulator, if the funds they manage are larger than USD 250 million for example. This was already the case in certain countries, for example in France, where fund managers have to be approved by the regulator in order to create FPCIs (the equivalent of a tax-efficient limited partnership).

However, what makes sense for the large and mega LBO fund managers may not be efficient for other private market fund managers. The cost of this regulatory burden can be high for small fund managers, thus creating barriers to entry if the regulation goes beyond a simple declaration and reporting of activity. Management fees are here to cover costs. Carried interest remains the true incentive for small fund managers, and their compensation is derived mainly from it.

In that sense, _large/mega LBO funds have to assess their position and take responsibility for their collective action_. Historically, they have benefitted from the lobbying of their venture capital peers, which were defending the industry's interests under the cover of general social and economic benefit. Today, their action is perceived as detrimental to the economy and puts the industry in a difficult position. Without any major change of behaviour and ethical amendment of their practices, the industry could face a splitbetween large/mega LBO fund managers (who often describe themselves as a 'private equity house') and the rest of the industry which wants to stay within a low-regulation environment. Should this happen, the 'private equity houses' would become the new versions of merchant and investment banks, and the private equity sector would focus on entrepreneurship and value creation as understood in this sector.

To avoid ill-adapted regulations, perhaps this split is advisable.

**Due Diligence Checklist**

_Note: this template is for illustration only and does not replace professional advice in the conception of such documents._

Each limited partner has its own motivations, targets and investment strategy, as well as tax, regulatory and statutory constraints. Due diligence is thus partly common to all limited partners, and also tailored to their specific needs.

Often, for public pension funds and large institutions, this due diligence is formalised into a request for proposal (RFP) or request for expression of interest (RFI). Some general partners exhibit specific features (first-time fund manager, emerging fund manager, specific investment strategy according to SRI1 guidelines, etc.) which require complementary questions.

Footnote 1: Sustainable and responsible investments.

The PPM (see below) provided by the general partner will answer some of the questions. Other questions will be answered by ad hoc requests or interviews. Answers have to be as factual as possible.

Limited partners' due diligence on private equity fund offerings is organised around four topics:

1. The investment strategy of the general partner a. Investment strategy, market(s) targeted and competition i. Market opportunity, recent evolution ii. Strategy, differentiating factors iii. Competitive advantage of the fund and fund manager iv. Competition intensity 1. Closest competitors, recent evolution 2. Valuation: evolution and relation to competition v. Risks 1. Risks involved by the strategy 2. Risk management b. Execution of the strategy i. Deal sourcing 1. Past - statistics 2. Key differentiators in current and future sourcing 3. Deals won/lost/rejected after due diligences (and reasons) ii. Deal structuring 1. Lead investor/follower 2. Board seats/observer 335* [20] M. C. C.

###### Abstract

The measurement of the company prepares the business plan, which should set ambitious but achievable targets.

Business plans range from 30 to more than 100 pages. They should address a rather broad public of investors, executives (current or would-be), stakeholders (including potentially banks, leasing companies, etc.), and thus be understandable by an educated but non-specialised public. They should hence avoid jargon and also baseless statements (i.e., all affirmations should be based on facts and figures).

The document should be revised regularly to reflect the progresses, obstacles encountered and new targets of the company. These update cycles are the occasion to reflect on past projections and targets, learn from the gaps between targets and achievements to set forth more accurate targets and achieve them with a higher degree of confidence.

The business plan should at least include the following elements:

This section is probably the most important. It sums up the content of the business plan, placed at the beginning to highlight the most important points, hence deliveringthe core messages of the business plan and guiding the reader. Hence, it is best written last, with significant effort, thought and time. In effect, investors will filter most of the opportunities in a first approach based on this section of the business plan.

The executive summary is not only factual, but also very clearly written, to the point and persuasive. It is an example of balance between a sales pitch (which refers to the offering and the market need) and a grounded argumentation (which refers to the operations, the processes and the company building).

The executive summary is usually developed over two to three pages (almost exclusively text).

### Background on the Company

Every company has a start - even if yet to be created. This section should provide the origins of the company and its history, its current situation, its activity (including past, present and projected), and what the management expects to achieve with the company in the future.

### Product(s) and/or Service(s)

What does the company do? It is important to describe its product(s) and/or service(s) not only in detail, but also in English understandable by an educated (but non-specialist) reader. Regardless of the level of technical sophistication of products or services, this section has to be written without jargon or technical language.

Beyond descriptions, this section should emphasise what is (are) the competitive advantage(s) of the product(s) and/or service(s) (against current or prospective competition), and what actual/prospective need this product/service fits (hence linking it with a solvent demand).

This section should also state precisely the current stage of development of each product and/or service, without anticipating this development stage (for example, idea, prototyping, beta-testing/pilot, go-to-market, industrialisation, export for consumer electronic products). As a matter of fact, the type of financing is related to the stage of development of the company and its products, as it requires different expertise, know-how, contacts and level of financing from the investors. Stating factually where the company stands on each product line and/or service.

It is also important to emphasise not only what will be done, or is currently done, but what has been done so far (including trials/errors, changes of course, past products and services) and it helps the investor to determine the strength of the current argumentation and to assess the product(s) and/or service(s) dynamics, vulnerability, pace of obsolescence and place in a given value chain.

Intellectual property and the protection thereof is hence part of this section, notably the patents (and current status), know-how, brands and other elements of protection.

### Exhibits:

* A Gantt diagram.
* A schedule.

These are advised as they help to figure out the degree of professionalism of the management, as well as its ability to cope with deadlines and milestones.

In venture capital, this is crucial as each capital injection is realised to reach the next milestone. Delays might imperil the company and/or the investments done so far (notably if fundraising happens as an emergency solution as a 'down round', which is highly dilutive for the current investors as the valuation of the company is drastically revised downwards). Investors have hence to assess how realistic the schedule is.

#### Customer Needs, Market Size and Solvency of Customers

A product/service without a significant and solvent market is useless. This section should combine descriptions and analysis, based on facts, to identify:

* What need the product/service answers. This should lead to the description of the industry and sectors where the company is positioned and later pave the way for a competitive assessment. The market(s) size(s) should be estimated here with factual data, as well as its/their past, current and future dynamics. The degree of maturity of the market has also to be assessed and connected to the section below (and notably which segment of the market is then addressed and how).
* Who are the customers? This should lead to a clear and grounded market segmentation. This should include distribution channels, purchase behaviours, description of purchase cycles, identification of the buyers, the payers and the users (who might be different groups of individuals); details about the solvency of the buyer (including how high/critical the purchase is on its list of purchases, as well as the rapidity of adoption of the product/service, and also price sensitivity); the delays in payments (including statistics about delinquencies) and other factual data to assess clearly the marketing strategy in the next section.
* How does the competition answer (at least partially) the need identified? This should encompass any alternative, including free/self-made products/services. Competitors can be current or prospective (note that some of the prospective competitors might be buyers of the company that the investor would finance). What are the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors? What are the barriers to entry/exit of this market? What is the market share of the main competitors? Who sets the pricing structure of the market (the market leader(s) usually do)?
* What were the main hurdles faced by existing actors in the past to answer the customer's needs? How were these problems overcome by the market (if they were)?
* What are the current risks, issues and concerns affecting your business and the industry?

#### Exhibits:

* A typical Porter's 'SWOT' (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis would help.

* Reference lists for each team member.
* Current and future organisation chart.

### Financial Projections

These projections should be in line with the above-mentioned sections, notably in the revenue and income projections, as well as recruitment. They should be ambitious, but realistic and grounded in fact. Realism should always take precedence over optimism or ambition.

What are the hypotheses supporting sales, costs (fixed and variable) and other elements of the profit and loss statements? How is the working capital built? What are its constraints? How can it be optimised going forward?

* What are the fundamental trends and elements affecting cash flows? What is the worst-case scenario? What are the triggers to correct the course of the cash flows in case of problems? Solutions?

* What are the sales prices (or fees charged)? Are there rebates involved? If so to whom, for which reason and at which level?
* Provide key ratios for further analysis and discussion with the investor.
* Provide best, base and worst-case scenarios, the triggers, the plan to address the worst-case scenario, the delays associated with it and the metrics to observe.
* What were the past capital increases (date, amounts, valuations, special rights such as options)? What are the current amounts required (if any) and under which conditions? What are the future amounts required (if any)? The same question applies to debt.
* What is the capital structure (capitalisation table) before and after financing, including options and dilution triggers?* **Exhibits:**
* Capitalisation table (current and future).
* Financial statements (past, present and future).

### Euit

What are the different exit scenarios (type, horizon) for the investors and for what kind of expected returns? Provide the current valuation method and result, and explain how the future return could be made.

**Example 2Business Case:

Merton Educational SA - A Private Equity

Operation Can Iide Another One

Business case prepared by Cyril Demaria & Rafael Sasso, January 2013.1

Footnote 1: The case has been developed solely for class discussion purposes. It should not be used, and has not been written to illustrate, endorse, judge or criticise management; and is not intended to be a source of primary data.

It is a busy morning in Sao Paulo, this 24th June 2009. Advent International has just announced its investment in one of the major listed educational companies: Kroton Educacional SA. The press headlines reflect the stock exchange's reaction: a bold move, which can pay off tremendously but has high stakes.

The market sentiment is that the Brazilian education market is on the verge of major shifts. It has been growing at a fast pace, propelled by the economic growth and the need for highly skilled workers. Private companies have thrived in this context. Some of them are now listed and the market is evolving fast, notably towards distance/e-learning. At the same time, competition is intensifying.

While Kroton Educacional SA is a very promising investment, stock prices of listed educational companies are languishing against the main index of the Brazilian stock exchange (BM&F Bovespa). Advent has now to prompt change in its new portfolio company, and there is more than one investment thesis at stake in private equity investing. Which of his options would be the best to transform Kroton into the Brazilian market leader?

The Brazilian private education market really took off in 1997-1999. A regulation change paved the way for the development of private for-profit educational institutions. Following this change, the market grew for 25 years at double-digit rates, however at a rather low margin, as a price war erupted between the different providers. Moreover, a certain lack of professionalism and ability to scale up their offer markedly affected certain companies.

Due to the combination of the price war, low margins and strong competition, the education sector has under-performed the Brazilian stock exchange evolution by 35% (see Figure BC.1).

The Brazilian education industry is highly fragmented. The private education market numbers 2472 schools, of which only 58 count more than 10 000 students, and 711 more than 1000 students. The top 20 schools account for only 20% of enrolments. In that respect, 2009 may be a catalyst for change: it has been a bad year for the sector, notably in terms of earnings degradation due to poor employment figures and the impact of delinquency on tuition payments (which can only be accounted for after 6 months).

The private education market in Brazil is composed of two segments: K-12 and the postgraduate segment.

### K-12 Market

The Brazilian government has strongly supported primary and secondary education over the last few years, which has led to a surge in national literacy rates (higher among 15-24-year-olds than in the general population). This in return has increased the percentage of the population which could potentially attend post-secondary schools. Education facilities are used in a dual way: during the day, they are schools for K-12 students. In the evening and at night, they support distance learning.

Kroton Educacional has a large national coverage through its offering in basic and secondary schools. Kroton's network counts roughly 600 schools (and 200 000 students) operated under the Pitagoras brand (see Exhibit 9).

### Post-Secondary Market

Accelerated growth in the private sector appeared after the approval of the LDB2 in 1996 (see Figure 2). From 1980 to 2000, the number of enrolled students doubled, and from 2000 to 2008 it doubled again.

Footnote 2: The Law 9.394/1996 (Directives and Bases of Education in Brazil) adopted in 1995 facilitated access to higher education, notably by changing the rules to launch courses and structure educational institutions. A rapid growth in higher education ensued, driven primarily by the private sector.

As of 2009, there are 2250 public and 244 private higher education institutions, but the private sector accounts for around 75% of undergraduate enrolments as the public system is unable to meet demand. The public system has a very elitist approach to higher education and covers only 12% of offers. 1 770 000 students are excluded yearly from the public system. The private sector can absorb every year roughly 82.5 000 who can afford the tuition fees, leaving 945 000 students outside the system. This adds up to 7 000 000 people excluded from higher education: hence less than 14% of 18-24-year-olds undertake higher education studies, making Brazil one of the worst performers among OCDE countries in terms of access to education.

The private schools' monthly standard tuition fee is around R$457. Students in a public university cost the Brazilian state nearly R$27 400 a year (in line with the cost in developed countries). From 2003 to 2008, the number of public university students jumped from 281 000 to 330 000. During the same period, the private sector expanded its enrolments from nearly 1 700 000 to more than 2 500 000.

From 1997 to 2003, the private sector grew fast (16.8% on a yearly average, or 154% over the period). But in 2003 and 2004, the growth slowed respectively to

Figure 2: Rate of enrolments in public and private post-secondary education in Brazil7.7% and 2%. The Brazilian government subsequently launched the ProUni programme (see below), and the growth rate recovered to 9.1% in 2005 (with 80 000 students benefitting from ProUni). Despite this programme, 2006 and 2007 saw the growth rates of the education market stall (3.8% and 2.8%, respectively).

Still, contradicting this trend, most of the analysts expect organic post-secondary growth to be the main driver of for-profit education companies in the following years, driven by a demand for skilled employees in industry. Morgan Stanley, for example, expected in June 2007 that the number of enrolments in post-secondary education would grow between 2007 and 2010 at an annual compound rate of 9.1% (see Figure BC.3).

According to the National Educational Plan (PNE), the Brazilian government is targeting a 50% gross enrolment rate in tertiary education by 2020 (vs roughly 30% in 2009, see Figure BC.4). The reward for post-secondary graduates is an increase in wages: on average they grow by 171% in Brazil (vs 62% in the USA), according to Hoper Educacional.

As of 2009, most post-secondary students in Brazil did not have access to public or private loans (unlike students of for-profit organisations in the USA). Brazilian students hence have to self-finance their post-secondary education, usually on a monthly basis, over the duration of the programme. The postgraduate segment is hence sensitive to macro-economic data, such as unemployment levels, working adults' sentiments about the future and their economic prospects, and access to credit to finance studies. Brazil has a low gross enrolment ratio compared to more developed countries (24% vs 70%), essentially because many families cannot afford to pay for private education. Credit is hence a key factor. Kroton used to offer a financing programme (INED3 programme) through which students could pay for their 24-30-month programme in a maximum of 36 instalments.

Footnote 3: See Exhibit 9 for the brand segmentation of Kroton.

### Tuition Financing Mechanisms

Alternative financings to fund higher education studies exist:

* Since 2006, Ideal Invest SA has managed funds dedicated to education, and has provided students with loans to finance college tuition (funding it on the capital markets through securitisation).
* PRAVALER is the main private programme to fund university studies in Brazil. Developed as an alternative to public schemes, it counts more than 260 education institutions as partners. Its shareholders count, among others, a fund managed by Victoria Capital Partners, the International Finance Corporation (IFC, the World Bank's financial arm), a fund managed by EOS Investments and Itau Bank. 12 500 courses are financed in the programme. Monthly interest rates vary from 0% to 1.99%.

To give access to post-secondary education to students (who are working adults) from middle- and low-income families, the government created programmes that have largely driven the increase in student enrolment numbers, mainly young working adults seeking better salaries and employment opportunities. The main programmes are ProUni (Programa Universidade Para Todos) and FIES (Financing for Higher Education Students).

### (a) Prelimi - Programa Universidade Para Todos

This programme, established in 2005 (see Table 1), exempts education institutions granting scholarships to low-income undergraduate students from certain federal taxes. To join the programme, institutions must:* Sign a contract for 10 years (renewable for a further 10 years), setting forth the number of scholarships to be offered in each programme, campus and course.
* Be up to date with their tax obligations.
* Offer scholarships to low-income students (at least one full scholarship for every 10.7 regular fee-paying students enrolled at the end of the previous academic year; or 8.5% of total revenue; or a full scholarship for every 22 regular fee-paying students in undergraduate and associate programmes, as long as they also offer 50% or 25% scholarships that add up to a total figure equal to 8.5% of the institution's annual revenue).

### (h) FES - Funde de Financiamento ao Estudante de Ensino Superior

In 1999 the Brazilian Ministry of Education launched Financing for Higher Education Students (FIES) to finance the post-secondary education of students enrolled at private institutions (higher education institutions). FIES finances up to 100% of the post-secondary tuition fees owed to the institutions enrolled in the programme. More than 500 000 students have already benefitted from it, and the number of institutions belonging to the programme increases constantly. Since 2005, FIES has begun to support students also in the ProUni programme, hence financing the remaining 50% of their post-secondary education costs with a loan. Many students have begun to use both programmes jointly.

Many discussions are currently taking place to change FIES and the ProUni programme. The MEC (Ministry of Education) is evaluating the possibility of students applying for FIES before getting into university, at any time during the year, with more time to repay and without a guarantor. Another possibility is the inclusion of banks in the process.

## Current Situation in Brazil

### Employment

From 7.5% in August 2008, the unemployment rate reached 9% at the beginning of 2009. Signs of recovery appeared, and the unemployment rate seems to have stabilised.

### Higher Education Market

The discussions in the industry are, in the short term, about margin normalisation driven by maturing capacities. Cost management emerges as a priority. In the long term, credit availability, economies of scale, branding and pricing power are identified as core topics. Distance learning is on everyone's lips and appears as a major relay of growth.

### Private Equity Investments

The fragmented Brazilian post-secondary education market has attracted the attention of private equity funds. Education institutions appeared as an investment opportunity, notably because of their growth prospects and as a market with a rising solvent demand. Patria Investimentos listed Anhanguera in 2007, thus making a good case for other institutions to follow suit. In May 2008, GP Investments acquired a 20% stake in Estacio, a major listed educational player. The firms are following an aggressive growth strategy through acquisitions and operational improvements.

## Competition of Kroton Educational Sa

At the beginning of 2009, four main contenders (including Kroton) were shaping the Brazilian educational market (see Exhibit 5). All of them are publicly listed on the Brazilian stock exchange (BM&F Bovespa). They are among the largest companies in this fragmented market.

### Anhanguera Educacional - AEsa

AESa was created in 2003 by four institutions, with at that time approximately 8848 students enrolled in seven campuses, in six cities in the state of Sao Paulo. Instituto Superior de Comunicacao Publicitaria (ISCP) and the holding company of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi are notable shareholders, which contributed financially to launch campuses (10 were open by the end of 2005) and brought to AESa their expertise and knowledge of the market. In 2005, the private equity house Patria Investments invested in AESa. Meanwhile, ISCP sold equity in AESa to the Fundo de Educacao para o Brasil (FEBR), which injected new funds in AESa. FEBR obtained a credit facility from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of USD 12 million for AESa. As a result, FEBR became AESa's controlling shareholder. As of 2009, AESa was the largest Brazilian for-profit educational organisation with 54 campuses, 450 e-learning centres and 650 teaching centres (according to the company).

The Anhanguera strategy is based on a unified pedagogical platform and a multi-operational model (providing AESa with scalability and economies of scale). In most cases, Anhanguera offers the lowest prices on the market. The teaching units are, in general, small to medium (with a capacity of 2000 to 7000 students). They are located in convenient places with easy access to public transport. The students are essentially young workers from D and C classes4 looking for career development.

* Post-secondary education on its own campuses for undergraduate and graduate programmes.

SEB's current strategy is focused on the expansion of its distance learning offer; implantation and expansion of post-secondary courses in the regional centres; continued investment in technology for education purposes; scalability and replication of offers; and continuing public sector partnerships.

## KROT Educational Sa

Kroton Educacional SA is a Brazilian for-profit organisation dedicated to private education, namely the K-12 and the post-secondary segments.

Kroton is listed on the Bovespa under 'level 2',6 which means that preferred shareholders have special rights under certain circumstances. This includes full tag-along rights in the case of a change in control; voting rights in the event of a merger, acquisition or spin-off; and approval of agreements between related-party transactions.

Footnote 6: Kroton moved to Novo Mercado on 5 December 2012 and is now listed under KROT3.

Since its IPO on the Bovespa (ticker: KROT11) at the end of 2007, the stock price of the company has been languishing (see Exhibit 2), despite significant financial results (see Exhibit 1) and growth in student enrolments (see Exhibit 7). The market capitalisation as of June 2009 was R$502 million (USD 255.7 million), for 31.5 million shares outstanding. The free float is 39%.

### KROT's Business Model

Kroton Educacional's business can be broken down into different activities:

* The management of pre-school, elementary, secondary and college preparatory schools ('K-12').
* Delivery of higher, professional and post-graduate education.
* Delivery of free courses, and other related educational activities.
* Wholesale, retail, distribution, import and export of textbooks, course books, magazines and other publications related to education.

The original business model of Kroton was developed and refined for the K-12 segment in the 1980s. Its offer was developed to be flexible and adapted to different local needs, while at the same time ensuring the delivery of contents subscribing to a constant level of quality. This approach is the key to Kroton's success and has been the source of its penetration into the post-secondary market. Thanks to this approach, Kroton benefits from a competitive advantage: its development is smoother and quicker.

This standardised platform provides Kroton with economies of scale, as well as ensuring at the same time a constant level of quality for every new school or campus added (whether an existing one or a new one). To deliver this high level of quality, Kroton closely tracks and oversees each partner or campus and provides high-quality training to professors and staff. Economies of scale are generated through the addition of new schools and campuses, as this requires very little or no adaptation of this platform. As the academic plan is standardised, this helps local staff to save time in planning and coordinating as well. Hence the network developed by Kroton is able to deliver the level of quality with no additional marginal cost.

So far, Kroton has been able to replicate this model and successfully implement it on 25 campuses. The company is hence perceived as a high-quality provider of basic and secondary education. It has successfully marketed its learning system to many private schools, based on a sales pitch of efficiency and cost-effectiveness towards quality. As a consequence, the Pitagoras7 offer has reached a 98% renewal rate for its learning system products and services. This has positioned Kroton as a leading company, ranked by number of students (see Figure 5). However, the number net of acquisitions actually decreased in Q1 2009, compared to Q2 2008 (see Exhibit 7).

Footnote 7: See Exhibit 9 for the brand segmentation of Kroton.

The Strategy of Kroton Educacional SA

So far, Kroton Educacional SA has essentially been propelled by organic growth (by opening new campuses or purchasing licences to start them). This has allowed the company to keep its costs rather low compared to the competition (see Figure 6), which focuses on buying existing campuses and then streamlining them.

#### Challenges

One of the questions faced by Kroton is whether it will be able to implement its platform in other segments of the education industry, such as public schools, post-secondary education and distance learning. Distance learning in particular has been a difficult area, where the competition has struggled to develop so far.

Public schools (52% of which are municipal schools) have witnessed an increase in their budgets and correlatively higher levels of expected quality, set by the national Education Development Plan (PDE). Private learning systems would help them to meet these academic goals. SEB, which declares 145 000 learning students on its system, has already started to actively market to this category of customers as the content for public schools is the same as for private schools. If that market segment were to help amortise the costs of Kroton over a broader base, that would also mean a more aggressive pricing strategy in this segment to gain market share.

#### Expectations

Kroton has one of the highest growth rates amongst education companies in Brazil. Its growth so far has essentially been organic, through the (re-)development of schools and campuses. This approach represents a cost advantage, compared to strategies based on mergers and acquisitions. According to Morgan Stanley, Kroton should reach 137 000 post-secondary enrolments by the end of 2012, representing growth of over 400% in the period, equivalent to a 39% CAGR. At the same time, Kroton should deliver a 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 57% (2007-12E).

Only a year later GPE VI (the largest mid-market buy-out fund, with EUR 6.6 billion) and ACEE IV (EUR 1 billion) were launched. The Mumbai office was then opened in 2009.

As of 2011, Advent International focused on'mid- and upper-mid-market buyouts', with roughly 170 investment professionals of 29 nationalities. It declares that it has invested in more than 600 companies in 41 countries, which has led to 140 IPOs.

### The LPEF Programme

It was in 1996 that Advent International opened its Buenos Aires and Mexico City offices, and the Latin American private equity fund (LAPEF) (USD 230 million) was launched. The Sao Paulo office opened in 1997. LAPEF II was raised in 2002 (USD 265 million). LAPEF III was raised in 2005 (USD 375 million). LAPEF IV was the largest-ever private equity fund focused on Latin America with USD 1.3 billion, and was raised in 2007. LAPEF V was launched in 2010, with USD 1.65 billion, which also marked the opening of the New York and Istanbul offices. The following year, the Bogota office was opened.

The LAPEF programme is focused on growth buy-outs of cash generative service businesses, with a primary geographic focus on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other selected Latin American countries. The typical equity investment realised is USD 50-200 million, in companies with a typical enterprise value of USD 50-750 million (or sometimes larger).

The industries targeted by the LAPEF programme are business services (including airport services and outsourcing), financial services, retail, consumer and leisure. Other sectors of investment include healthcare, industrial sectors, technology, media and telecommunications.

Its methods of investment are overall through control positions, but Advent International also considers minority investments if the proper governance is in place. Buy-outs are hence the main strategy of investment (acquisition of a business from its current owner, being a corporation, a family, a founder or through a de-listing). Expansion funding is another way of investing, to fund organic growth or market consolidation.

### Values and Investment Philosophy

Advent International prides itself on working as a single and integrated team. All decisions are based on 'analytical study, open debate and consensus conclusions'. Advent's declared investment philosophy is 'centered on value creation driven through an active ownership approach'. One of the main differentiating factors, beyond the international approach which has characterised it since its inception, is a focus on growth (organic, external) and operational improvement, 'not on financial engineering'. It highlights the operational and consulting background of its professionals, as well as 60 'industry-specific operating partners'.

Acting as independent advisors, operating partners are former C-level executives who work alongside Advent's investment team to help portfolio companies in their development. These operating partners offer a strong industry knowledge, operational know-how, management experience and contacts. They can hold positions such as chairman or Board member in the portfolio companies, or may even be interim managers.

Investment decisions are taken by regional investment advisory committees, 'which review potential investment opportunities and oversee existing portfolio companies'.

These committees are made up of professionals from a specific region and a partner from another region 'to provide continuity and consistency across the process globally'.

### The Sao Paulo Office

Headed by Juan Pablo Zucchini, Managing Director and Patrice Etlin, Managing Partner, the Brazilian office of Advent International numbers 19 employees (of which 13 are investment professionals). By comparison, the Mexico office numbers 19 employees (14 investment professionals), the Bogota office 11 employees (8 investment professionals) and the Buenos Aires office 6 employees (4 investment professionals). Advent International won the 'Latin American Private Equity Firm of the Year' poll from the _Private Equity International_ review in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011. Table BC.3 provides examples of investments realised by the Sao Paulo office.

## The Transaction

On 24th June 2009 (see Exhib 6), Kroton Educacional SA and Advent International announced that the latter would invest R$280 million (at R$16.2 per share, a 1.3% premium on the previous day's price and a 19% premium on the average price of the last 60 trading days) for a 50% stake in PAP (Pitagoras Adm. e Part.). PAP is the controlling entity of Kroton (see Exhib 4), with a 55% stake. The private placement will lead to a subscription of Advent of 101.98 million common shares and 20.93 million preferred shares.

Following this investment, PAP would increase Kroton's capital by R$220 million at a price of R$12.53 (the subscription ratio is 1.016:1 at R$12.53/unit, a 7.7% discount to the stock's average price on the prior 60 days, and a 22% discount on the previous day of closing). Minority shareholders benefit from subscription rights, which could lead to an equity increase of R$387 million. If they do not participate, that would imply a dilution of 36% in terms of number of shares. The free float would drop from 39% to 25%. The final amount of the capital increase was R$387 million (100% subscription).

As a result, Advent International will have three seats on the Board (out of a total of nine, see Exhib 8) and will chair the human resources and financial/M&A committees. The academic and audit committees will be presided by other experts.

## Questions Supporting the Case Resolution

* How would you describe Advent International's investment in Kroton? To what extent is it a typical private equity investment? How much does it differ from a typical private equity investment?
* What is the rationale of Advent International's investment in Kroton? What is the current strategy of Kroton? How would Advent International's investment modify this strategy?
* What are the main challenges that Kroton faces? What are its assets to answer these challenges? (To answer this question, a SWOT analysis may be required.)
* How would you explain the premium and discounts that Advent International pays/benefits from at the time of investment? What could justify both of them?
* Value Kroton with the DCF and multiple methods and compare the result with the current share price of Kroton (R$16.00/share) and the price paid by Advent International (see Exhib 3 to support your reasoning). What are your conclusions?

## 6 Press release of the investment of Advent International in Kroton Educacional SA

**Kroton Educacional to receive investment from Advent International**

_With funding from Advent International, controlling holding company of Kroton will inject_

_R$220 million for a capital increase in the company to support its expansion plans._

Kroton Educacional S.A. (Bovespa: KROT11) - 'Kroton' or 'the Company', one of the largest private education companies in Brazil, and Advent International, a global private equity firm, today announced an agreement in which PAP (Pitagoras Administracao e Participacao S.A.), the holding company that controls Kroton with 55% of its capital, will receive a capital injection of R$280 million from Advent International, R$220 million of which will be used to fund a capital increase in Kroton through a private subscription of additional shares in a total amount of up to R$387.9 million. After the deal, Advent will have 50% of PAP and indirectly approximately 28% of Kroton.

Kroton is Advent's 15th investment in Brazil since 1997, when it started its activities in the country. Funding for this deal will come from LAPEF IV (Latin American Private Equity Fund IV) raised in 2007 and capitalised at US$1.3 billion. Since the raising of LAPEF IV, Advent has already invested in four companies in Brazil: Viena, Brazil's leading casual dining restaurant chain; Franco Assado, Brazil's leading highway restaurant chain; Quero-Quero, a home-improvement retailer in southern Brazil; and CETIP, the largest central depository for private fixed-income securities and over-the-counter derivatives in Latin America. Founded in 1966, Kroton offers primary, secondary and post-secondary education programmes throughout Brazil. In the K-12 segment (kindergarten to high school), the company has 654 associate schools in Brazil that make use of its Pitagoras learning system. In the post-secondary segment, it has 28 campuses (17 Pitagoras units which offer 4- to 5-year undergraduate and 1-year graduate programmes and 11 INED units which offer 2.5- to 3-year associate programmes). Kroton has more than 43,000 post-secondary students and 226,000 K-12 students.

Since July 2007, when Kroton raised R$455.8 million (US$245 million) with its initial public offering on Bovespa, the Company has embarked on an aggressive expansion plan, which has included the acquisition of 12 colleges and the opening of new campuses. Today, Kroton has the highest growth rate of any education company in Brazil, with net revenues of R$279.6 million and EBITDA of R$51.5 million in 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the company posted net revenues of R$107.5 million and an EBITDA of R$35.7 million, rising 51.4% and 37.6% respectively over the year-earlier figures.

'Kroton combines high-quality education services, a proven track record of organic and acquisition-led growth and a highly-skilled management. We believe the company provides a strong platform from which to consolidate the education sector in Brazil and we look forward to working with the management team to accelerate the expansion of the business,' said Juan Pablo Zucchini, a Managing Director in Advent International's Sao Paulo office. Mr. Zucchini led the investment in Kroton.

'It's a very fragmented market, with many opportunities ahead', Mr. Zucchini added. 'The Brazilian education sector has been growing at a compound annual rate of 10% over the past decade and is still characterized by a low number of students with post-secondary degrees, even relative to other countries in Latin America.'* [14] M.

100-Day plan Series of measures and dispositions that a company acquired through an LBO (_see this expression_) is expected to execute after its acquisition. This series includes back-up measures in case the original plan fails to deliver the expected results.

## Appendix A A Aborted deal costs

_See_ 'Broken deal costs'.

**Accelerated monitoring fees**: At the time of investment, the LBO fund manager determines an annual monitoring and control fee charged to a portfolio company along an expected holding period. If the portfolio company is sold or listed ahead of the planned schedule, the remaining amount due is then charged all at once by the LBO manager before the exit: it is the accelerated monitoring fee.
**Accelerator**: Also referred to as'start-up accelerator'. This is a 6- to 18-month programme dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs at the inception of their company. Accelerators usually provide a mix of lectures, workshops, mentorship and events with the aim of supporting the start-up in its fundraising. Most programmes culminate in a final event where start-ups can pitch (_see this expression_) themselves to potential investors.
**Accredited investor**: An investor deemed sufficiently informed and sophisticated, who benefits from a satisfactory knowledge of investments and is thus able to handle private market investments, which do not benefit from the protection offered by stock exchange regulations. In the USA, this status is defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940.
**Acquior due diligence**: Also known as 'buy-side due diligence'. _See_ 'Due diligence'.
**Acquisition**: The take-over of a portfolio company by another industrial or financial company.
**Active ownership**: For a shareholder, consists of exercising dutifully his/her rights and fulfilling all associated duties, and actively advising the management of a firm. If the shareholder is a Board member of a company, this includes exercising the rights and duties of a Board member.
**Activism**: In finance, consists of a series of actions supporting a campaign to bring significant change in the management and governance of a company. An activist investor usually acquires a minority stake in a listed company, launching a communication campaign to get support for a bid for one or multiple Board seats. The purpose is to act decisively to change the strategy of the company by convincing or changing the management of a firm. Activist investors are compensated by the resulting increase in price of the shares they own and/or distribution of dividends.

**Add-on transaction** Direct or indirect acquisition of a firm by a private equity fund, to be further merged or associated with a company already in the portfolio of the fund: the platform (_see_ 'Platform deal').

**Adverse selection** Any situation when an investor systematically gets investment opportunities of lower quality or return potential due to a disadvantage when interacting with a better-informed party.

**Advisory Board** Group of fund investors or third parties advising a fund manager on a specific fund. The powers of this Board are limited to simple advice on topics ranging notably from valuation of assets to solving conflicts of interest.

**Advisory Committee** Informal group of individuals advising a fund manager on specific questions.

**Agency theory** A branch of economic theory that deals with the question of asset owners and their agents. An agency relationship exists when the owner pays the agent to take decisions in his place. The contract plays an important role in ensuring that the agent acts in the best interests of the owner. Agency costs are evidenced by the fact that contracts are costly and difficult to enforce. They include structuring costs, management costs and the application of multiple contracts between agents with different interests.

**AFMD** _See_ 'Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive'.

**Alignment of interests** Usually refers to an arrangement between an agent and a principal in which the agent stands to benefit more from a cooperation with the principal than if the agent tries to maximise his own single outcome.

**Alternative assets** If traditional investments refer to listed stocks, listed bonds and cash, alternative assets refer to non-traditional investments. This category includes notably private market investments, hedge funds, commodities and derivatives.

**Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive** EU-wide regulation introduced in 2011 to provide a common regime for managers of funds dedicated to non-traditional assets, namely hedge funds and private market funds. To market their funds within the EU, alternative investment fund managers have to obtain authorisation from at least one national EU regulator. This authorisation is delivered upon compliance with transparency and investor protection provisions.

**American waterfall** Variant of the schedule of distribution of the performance fee ('carried interest', _see tbis expression_) of a fund manager. According to this, the carried interest (if any) is distributed to the fund manager each time an investment has been sold profitably by the fund and the 'hurdle rate' (_see tbis expression_) has been paid. If the fund sold investments at a loss, some or all the carried interest distributed to the fund manager has to be recalled according to a 'clawback clause' (_see this expression_) to compensate the investors for their loss.

**Anchor investor** _See_ 'Cornerstone investor'.

**Angel investor** A high net worth individual who invests in venture capital to help companies and let them benefit from his experience, his network and his know-how. Also called 'business angel'.

**Anti-dilution clause** Clause in a shareholders' agreement (usually of a start-up) that entitles some investors to maintain their ownership percentage in a company by buying additional shares of a company in subsequent financing rounds. If the subsequent roundof fundraising is done at a lower valuation than the current one (a 'down round', _see this expression_), the option will compensate beneficiary investors with additional shares to maintain their ownership percentage.

**Asset allocation** Breakdown of a portfolio between different categories of assets. For an institutional investor, this usually involves listed stocks, listed bonds, local and foreign currencies, hedge funds, commodities, gold and private market investments. For a fund manager, this usually involves companies of different sectors and possibly geographical regions.

**Asset stripping** Process of selling off part of a company with the hope that the proceeds from this sale will be higher than if the company was sold as a whole.

**Assets under management** The sum of all the assets managed (that is to say, those available for investment and those already invested) by an investment team in private market deals.

**Asymmetry of information** Situation in which one economic agent has better information than another, placing the second at a disadvantage compared to the first when choosing an investment. For example, an entrepreneur can benefit from a higher level of information than an investor in a company. The entrepreneur extracts this information from his day-to-day activity while the investor relies on the summary provided by the entrepreneur for his information. Current investors in a company also benefit from higher information than prospective ones, which is why the latter undertake due diligence (_see this expression_) to reduce or eliminate the asymmetry of information.

**Auction** Process of selling a company potentially involving multiple competing buyers. The purpose of this process is usually to maximise the proceeds for the seller.

**AUM** _See_ 'Assets under management'.

**B Balance sheet** The picture of the financial situation of a company at a given time. The balance sheet is the synthesis of the value of assets, debts and capital of the company.

**Balanced fund** An investment strategy in private equity designed to build a portfolio of companies at different stages of development (venture capital, growth capital, and/or leveraged buy-out).

**Bankruptcy** Legal status declared by a special court under which a company which is either insolvent (_see tbis expression_) or has sustained cumulated losses superior to its total capital for a prolonged period of time (usually 2 years) is placed under administration and supervised by an independent third party. The debt (interest and principal) repayment of the company is suspended for the length of the bankruptcy procedure (usually 6 to 18 months), which usually ends with the restructuring of the company or its liquidation.

**BDC** _See_ 'Business Development Company'.

**Beauty contest** Competitive process in which each potential buyer of a business/asset tries to convince a seller (and his agents) and win over other potential buyers. This process can be compared to an auction, except that the decision factors are not only the price offered but other elements such as reputation, credentials or track record.

**Benchmark**: Metrics of performance, risk and liquidity of a fund or a company, to support a comparison with a peer group (_see this expression_).
**Blind pool**: Feature of a fund according to which investors do not know at the time of investment which assets will be acquired and have no influence on the choice of these assets. Investors usually know at least the detailed investment strategy applied by the fund, that is criteria such as geographical area, type of investment strategy applied, size and type of asset and time at which industrial sectors targeted.
**Blocker**: Structure set up in a specific country to gather commitments in a fund located in another country. _See_ 'Feeder fund'.
**Bolt-on transaction**: _See_ 'Add-on transaction'.
**Book value**: Using the balance sheet of a company, it is computed as the total value of the assets (after depreciation) minus the outstanding liabilities.
**Bottom quartile**: 25% of a sample ranking lowest according to specific criteria, such as a performance metric.
**Bottom-up**: Progressing from the lowest (or most granular) to the highest (or least granular) level of an analytical process. In the context of asset allocation, this consists of analysing the micro-economic factors of an asset to draw specific conclusions and build a portfolio from this analysis. The positive side of this approach is that it is empirically verifiable and can be concretely applied. The negative side of this approach is that it depends on observable samples and therefore might lack systematism. A complementary approach is 'top-down' (_see this expression_).
**Break-up fee**: Financial sanction that the seller of a company in an LBO transaction has to pay when walking away from the transaction. If it is the prospective buyer who walks away, then the fee is called a'reverse break-up fee'.
**Bridge financing**: Short-term financing generally provided as a credit to a company expecting a financing event (IPO or further round of financing) in the coming 6 to 12 months. The bridge financing can combine debt and equity features. If so, this debt instrument is then generally converted into shares at the time of the liquidity event.
**Bridge loan**: _See_ 'Bridge financing'.
**Broken auction**: Competitive sale process of a company which failed to effectively translate into an effective acquisition.
**Broken deal costs**: _See_ 'Broken deal fees'.
**Broken deal fees**: Buy-side expenses associated with the analysis of an investment opportunity that did not materialise into an effective investment. These expenses are supported by the potential buyer with no associated investment to recoup them.
**Brownfield**: Refers to real assets, such as real estate or infrastructure, which have already been developed and are not currently in use. The underlying land can be contaminated, notably by pollution.
**Bullet payment**: Feature of a loan according to which the principal and the cumulated interest is paid all at once, usually at the end of the duration of the loan.
**Burn rate**: Measure of the net cash spent by a start-up at a given time occurrence (usually monthly). It is notably used to assess how many months the start-up can operate before it runs out of funds (and therefore plan for a new round of financing).

Business angel_See_ 'Angel investor'. Business Development CompanyListed US closed-end investment vehicle created in 1980 through an amendment of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If a company elects to be a BDC, and matches the criteria, it pays little or no corporate income tax as it is a pass-through tax structure.

## Appendix C

Capital accountReport on the position held by an investor in a private market fund, including capital committed, capital paid in, investments, valuations and realisations. Capital callOperation through which the fund collects a portion of the commitments of its fund investors to invest in portfolio companies and pay for its expenses (and notably the management fees). Capital increaseOperation in which investors provide additional resources, in cash or in kind, to a company in exchange for shares. As a result, the equity of the company increases. Capitalisation tableList of shareholders of current and future company, usually detailing the percentage of ownership, number of shares and stock options owned by each of them. Captive managerA private market fund manager that is totally (captive) or partially (semi-captive) owned by a large group or a financial institution. Carried interestThe share of the profit generated by a fund manager that is dedicated to the investment team (fund manager) without any initial financial contribution to the fund. It is generally 20% of the profits generated by the fund ('whole fund carried interest', also called European waterfall), or sometimes by each of the investments of a fund ('deal-by-deal carried interest', also called American waterfall). Carve-outConversion of an activity, a business unit or a division of a company into an independent company, which can subsequently be sold by the corporation it originates from.

**Catch-up**: Mechanism entitling the fund manager to collect the pro rate of the 'hurdle rate' (_see this expression_) collected by fund investors.
**Cherry picking**: Choosing only the best opportunity from what is available.
**Chief investment officer**: Board-level executive of an institutional investor (or a family office) in charge of overseeing the asset allocation (_see this expression_), the investment selection, monitoring and reporting.
**CIO**: _See_ 'Chief investment officer'.
**Clawback clause**: Requires the fund manager to return distributions to fund investors. This provision is associated with the early distribution of carried interest (_see this expression_) to the fund manager under an American waterfall (_see this expression_). The carried interest distributed with the successful realisation of early investments could be clawed back if successor deals fail to generate sufficient performance to return the capital to fund investors (and the associated potential hurdle rate). If a fund distributes carried interest deal by deal and registers highly successful exits initially and weaker ones later on, this provision ensures that fund investors will ultimately get back was is owed to them according to fund regulations.
**CLO**: _See_ 'Collateralised loan obligation'.
**Closed-end**: Feature of a fund according to which it is created and dissolved at a pre-determined specific date. The lifespan of the fund is thus set at the start. It is not opened to new investors after the end of its fundraising period and investors have no redemption right before the dissolution.
**Closed-end fund**: _See_ 'Closed-end'.
**Closed-ended**: _See_ 'Closed-end'.
**Closing**: During the creation of a fund, the fund manager accumulates the commitments of the investors who are interested. The closing is the effective gathering of a critical volume of commitments and the signature of subscription agreements to the limited partnership agreement (_see this expression_). The fundraising can last a year or more, and the fund manager can make multiple closings (initial, intermediate and final) to indicate the progress of the process, set up its operations and begin to invest rapidly.

The term also applies to the materialisation of an investment in a portfolio company. The closing is the signature of the transfer of ownership (LBO) or of the capital increase (venture capital and growth capital).
**Club deal**: Leveraged buy-out operated by a group of private equity funds.
**Cluster of financing**: Geographical aggregation of venture capital investors that have reached a critical mass to attract companies and entrepreneurs and have developed sector expertise. The most emblematic cluster is the American Silicon Valley in information technologies.
**Co-investment**: Option or right offered to invest alongside a private market fund directly in a portfolio company or asset. The investor is usually also investing in the private market fund itself, but can hence choose to increase his exposure in select companies or assets.

**Co-investment fund**: Private market fund investing in portfolio companies or assets jointly with other vehicles managed by a fund manager. This fund is usually offered to specific investors only, and supports lower fees and carried interest than usual.
**Co-lead investor**: Prospective investor (usually in a start-up) who negotiates jointly with another one (the lead investor) the terms of a capital increase in a start-up with usually the management of the firm (representing existing investors).
**Collateral**: An asset from a borrower pledged so that a debt or a security will be repaid or refunded. This can be linked to a specific debt or a series of transactions. For example, entrepreneurs must sometimes provide personal collateral for the loans provided to their company.
**Collateralised loan obligation**: Securitisation vehicle often rated by an independent agency, in which a large number of loans are pooled together and then sliced in tranches with various levels of seniority (and therefore risk). These tranches are then sold to investors, who are entitled to the payment of interest and the repayment of the principal. The interest rate varies according to the risk supported by the investor in a given tranche.
**Commingled fund**: Investment vehicle that gathers capital from different sources and blends them together. Private market funds of funds (_see this expression_) are commingled funds as opposed as mandates (_see this expression_).
**Committed capital**: _See_ 'Fund size'.
**Commitment**: The obligation for an investor to provide a certain amount of capital to a fund. By extension, it is the amount committed by an investor in a fund or fund of funds, including those that are agreed on but not yet called. The sum of the commitments of all investors equals the fund size.
**Common equity**: _See_ 'Common shares'.
**Common shares**: Group of securities representing the ownership of a company that embeds one voting right and one dividend right per share. Any divergence from this rule qualifies these securities as 'preferred shares' (_see this expression_) if they have more rights. Common shares are usually held by entrepreneurs and employees of a company.
**Companion fund**: _See_ 'Parallel fund'.
**Concerted action**: Shareholders acting in concert according to a (formal or informal) agreement for the acquisition of the shares of a company, to achieve, maintain or increase their control over this company.
**Conflict of interests**: Position in which an economic agent has competing professional or personal motivations, leading to a risk of unethical or improper actions.
**Consulting fees**: Compensation paid to the provider of services to a portfolio company.
**Conversion rights**: An option or financial right attached to a debt financing instrument, notably mezzanine debt. Under specific pre-negotiated conditions, it guarantees that the owner of this financing instrument will get access to an equity stake in the company and hence a share of the profits. In that respect, subordinated debt providers can be paid for the higher risk that they take, compared to other debt providers.
**Convertible debt**: Often subordinated, this tranche of debt can be converted (optional conversion) or has to be converted (mandatory conversion) into a given company's

**Cost of capital**: Rate of return expected by the shareholders of a company. It is usually measured by the CAPM model, which states that the capital cost equals the risk-free rate plus a premium which varies according to the systemic risk (which cannot be diversified by the portfolio construction) and the market price of risk (around 6.5% by unit of beta).
**Cost of debt**: Interest rate requested by the banks from a company.
**Cost of liabilities**: Rate of return expected for the different means of financing. The total cost of liabilities is the compounded average rate of return of all the sources of financing used by the company.
**Covenant-light**: Qualification applied to a loan whose contract includes a lower number of clauses protecting the lender than in a usual contract. The borrower thus benefits from a higher flexibility, often without incurring a higher interest rate. The flexibility can be related to the repayment schedule, the ability to contract additional debt, make investments, pay dividends, forgo and accumulate the payment of interests for a certain period of time or any other form of flexibility that would usually be limited or prohibited.
**Covenant-lite**: _See_ 'Covenant-light'.
**Covenant-loose**: Qualification applied to a loan whose contract includes a very low number (usually one or two) of clauses protecting the lender, providing the borrower with high flexibility.
**Covenants**: Restrictions imposed by a lender on a borrower. Generally associated with the necessity of maintaining a certain level of cash, or certain ratios, or certain levels of investment in an LBO.
**Credit line**: _See_ 'Equity bridge financing'.
**Cross investment**: Process in which two funds managed by the same fund manager invest in the same underlying asset. Cross investments can create a conflict of interest for the fund manager if the two funds have different time horizons (one might have to sell its assets earlier than the other, for example).
**Crowdfunding**: Mechanism matching a company in fundraising mode with a multitude of potential investors (often retail or business angels), notably over the Internet, hence disintermediating the process of private market investing. The company can raise capital (equity crowdfunding), debt (crowdlending), or collect money as a donation or against a product or service.
**Crowdlending**: _See_ 'Crowdfunding'.
**Custodian**: Specialist institution dedicated to the certification of cash flow movements of funds. It acts as a trusted third party to guarantee that the fund manager handles the cash of a private market fund in a specific way.
**D Data room**: Large series of detailed documents gathered by the seller of a company to prepare the due diligence of (a) prospective buyer(s).
**Deal-by-deal carried interest**: _See_ 'American waterfall'.
**Deal flow**: Investment opportunities presented to a financial institution.

**Debt-for-trading**: Distressed debt investment strategy usually applied by hedge funds and consisting of acquiring at a discount listed bonds or loans of a distressed company. Once the company has solved its issues, bonds or loans recover their value and investors can then sell and book a profit. _See_ 'Distressed debt investing'.
**Decile**: The segment of a sample representing a sequential 10%. Thus, the first 10 of 100 funds are the first (or top) decile and the last 10 are the last (or bottom) decile.
**Default**: Event in which a promise to pay out a financial obligation (such as repaying a loan or answering a capital call) has been breached.
**Defaulting investor**: Fund investor who does not answer a capital call.
**Delisting**: A private equity transaction implying an offering on the total of the capital of a listed company to take it private.
**Development fund**: Venture capital fund dedicated to later-stage start-ups. _See also_ 'Expansion capital'.
**Dilution**: A process through which the percentage of participation of an investor in a company is reduced by the issue of new shares.
**Direct alpha**: _See_ 'Public market equivalent'.
**Direct investment**: Capital increase in or acquisition of a company with no intermediate investment vehicle. A direct investment can be a 'co-investment' (_see this expression_) or a'solo investment' (_see this expression_).
**Direct lending**: Private debt strategy similar to traditional bank lending. A lender provides a borrower with an amount of debt that is progressively repaid along with the interest computed on the outstanding amount still due. Also known as senior lending.
**Direct secondaries**: _See_ 'Secondary investing'.
**Discount rate**: Price value of time. It is notably used to determine the present value of future cash flows in the formula VA = FV\({}_{t}\)/(1 + \(K\))\({}^{t}\), where VA is the present value, FV\({}_{t}\) is the future value at end of year \(t\), and \(K\) is the cost of capital.
**Discounted cash flows (DCF)**: A method of evaluating investments by compounding the value of the future cash flows of a company by the actual value of these flows. When it is necessary to decide whether to invest or not in a given project, the future cash flows of an investment are discounted to get a value at the time the project would be initiated. The discount rate is the expected rate of return from the investors. In theory, if the actual value of future cash flows is higher than the invested amount, the investment should be made.
**Dissolution of a fund**: Point of the lifespan of a fund at which its assets have all been sold, it is free from any warranty or obligation and can be effectively wound up.
**Distressed debt investing**: Acquisition at a discount of some of the debt of a company in financial trouble. This strategy is a case where hedge funds and private debt funds can overlap in their activities. Distressed debt hedge funds acquire the debt and hold it until the value increases ('debt-for-trading'). Private debt funds focusing on distressed debt acquire the debt and convert some or all of it to shares. They restructure the company and sell it once the company is back on track ('loan-to-own').
**Distribution**: Payment made by a fund to its fund investors, usually in cash. If not, it is a distribution in kind (_see this expression_).

**Distribution in kind** Although very restricted, or outright forbidden, some fund regulations allow the distribution of securities to fund investors, instead of cash. These securities are usually traded on an organised and regulated financial market with a minimum threshold of liquidity. These securities can be subject to a 'lock-up period' (_see this expression_) if they are distributed after an 'initial public offering' (_see tbis expression_).

**Distribution to paid-in (DPI)** Ratio between the amount distributed by the fund (from the proceeds of its divestments) and the total of capital calls (paid-in).

**Distribution waterfall** Schedule of distribution of the performance fee (carried interest) of a fund manager. Two variants are usually differentiated: the American waterfall (_see this expression_) and the European waterfall (_see tbis expression_). Each variant can involve different features such as a clawback clause (_see this expression_) for the American variant, or a catch-up clause (_see tbis expression_) in the European variant.

**Divestment** The sale of a part or all of an investment through a trade sale or an initial public offering. _See_ 'Exit (of an investment)'.

**Divestment period** Subsequent to the investment period, the divestment period represents a 5- to 12-year timeframe during which a fund develops and sells or lists its investments. If necessary, this period can be extended by 1 to 3 years, if the fund regulations allow it. At the end of the divestment period, the fund is supposed to have sold all its holdings and be free of any warranties. If not, the fund manager has the choice to sell the assets on the secondary market ('direct secondaries', _see tbis expression_) or to other investors, transfer these assets in a new fund ('GP-led restructuring', _see this expression_) or extend the lifespan of the fund beyond the initial plan.

**Dividend recapitalisation** Partial or full refund of the capital injected in an LBO thanks to the payment of a special dividend by the holding. This dividend is usually the proceeds of an increase in debt, or, more rarely, the disposal of an asset of the underlying portfolio company.

**Down round** Venture capital investment round where the valuation of the company is inferior to the previous one.

**Downstream** Generally refers, in the oil and gas industry, to the refining of crude oil and the processing and purifying of natural gas, as well as the distribution of derived products.

**DPI**_See_ 'Distribution to paid-in'.

**Drag along clause** Disposition of a shareholders' agreement according to which the majority shareholder can force minority shareholders to sell their shares at the same price as his/hers to a third party, unless minority shareholders buy his/her shares at the price offered by this third party.

**Drawdown**_See_ 'Capital call'.

**Dry powder** At a fund level, the portion of the fund size that has not yet been called. At the private market industry level, the sum of all the capital committed but not yet deployed.

**Due diligence** Investigation resulting in independent and detailed analysis process preceding an investment. It is realised by or for investors of a given target company or a fund. In the case of a company, this includes a detailed analysis of the hypothesis of a business plan, as well as checking material facts (client accounts, contracts, bills, etc.)and opinions. Applied to a fund, this consists of determining the attractiveness, risks and issues of an investment strategy, a track record and the set-up of the fund and its manager.

**Duration of a fund**_See_ 'Lifespan of a fund'.

**Duration of an investment**_See_ 'Holding period'.

## Appendix E Early-stage financing

This includes seed investments and the first rounds of financing of a company.

**Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)**: This measure is calculated in the profit and loss statement of a company. Depending on the accounting methods, it can be calculated from the turnover of which inputs such as costs of goods and services sold are deducted: wages; marketing, general and administrative expenses; depreciations and amortisations. _See_ 'EBITDA'.

**Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)**: This measure is calculated in the profit and loss statement of a company. Depending on the accounting methods, it can be calculated from the turnover of which the inputs such as costs of goods and services sold are deducted: wages; marketing, general and administrative expenses. Depending on the financial structure and the activity of the company, it can be relevant to use a multiple of EBIT (or EBITA for telecom companies) or EBITDA, or any other financial instrument of measurement (EBITDAR - with R standing for rental of aircraft - for airlines, for example).

**Earn-out clause**: The final price to be paid to the vendor by an acquirer depends on the realisation of results announced in the business plan. To ease negotiations, the vendor and the buyer can settle on a temporary price and simultaneously negotiate a future potential complementary payment (the earn-out) to the vendor. This complementary payment to the vendor is triggered by the realisation of certain results by the company. These results are the fruits of efforts initiated before the transaction by the vendor, but which will be materialised after the acquisition and hence attributed to the buyer. Thanks to this mechanism, the vendor can retain an interest in the company for the compensation of efforts he has undertaken and results that he has contributed to, but the proceeds of which are difficult to evaluate at the time of the sale.
**Employee buy-out (EBO)**: An LBO in which the employees have the opportunity to acquire a significant amount of shares in the company.
**Employee stock-option plan (ESOP)**: Programme enabling a firm's employees to become owners, as compensation for work done.
**Endowment**: Process of transferring the ownership of assets to a non-profit structure. By extension, it designates the tax-efficient structure in which assets are transferred to a beneficiary owner, which can be an institution (such as a university, for example). Assets can be in cash or in kind. The endowment is managed independently and invests these assets whenever possible. The endowment can then spend the proceeds of these investments, and only these. The assets bequeathed to the endowment cannot be spent. To keep their tax-exempt status, endowments have to respect specific rules.
**Enterprise value (EV)**: Sum of the equity value and the net debt of a firm.

**Entry multiple**: Valuation ratio set when an investor acquires or invests in a company or an asset (the 'entry'). It is usually computed by dividing the enterprise value of the company or asset at entry by a subtotal from its profit and loss statement (such as the EBIT, _see this expression_) or cash flow statement.
**Environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria**: Set of informal standards used by investors to screen opportunities to invest in projects and companies. Environmental criteria support the analysis of a company's or an asset's stewardship of nature. Social criteria support the analysis of a company's or an asset's relationship with the community in which they operate, such as employees, suppliers, clients, partners and stakeholders. Governance criteria support the analysis of a company's or an asset's ownership framework, including management control and sanction, and owners' rights and duties.
**Equalisation mechanism**: Process consisting of establishing a strict equality between investors joining the roster of a fund at different closing dates. Investors joining after the first closing have to compensate initial investors, usually by paying initial investors interest. Interest is in effect collected by the fund manager and paid pro-rata to investors in the first closing.
**Equity**: Sum of capital provided by shareholders plus the sum of undistributed profits or losses.
**Equity bridge financing**: Also known as 'credit line','subscription line facilities' or 'capital call facilities', these financing instruments are short-term (less than 365 days) loans provided to private market funds backed by the commitments of fund investors. Capital calls can then be delayed, along with the start of the computation of the IRR associated with them. Distributions can also be anticipated, thus affecting the computation of the IRR.
**Equity crowdfunding**: _See_ 'Crowdfunding'.
**Equity kicker**: _See_ 'Conversion right'.
**End of life**: Point at which a closed-end fund reaches its maximum contractual lifespan.
**ESG**: _See_ 'Environmental, social and governance criteria'.
**ESOP**: _See_ 'Employee stock-option plan'.
**European waterfall**: Variant of the schedule of distribution of the performance fee ('carried interest', _see this expression_) of a fund manager. According to this, the carried interest (if any) is distributed to the fund manager only once the capital of the fund has been returned to investors and the 'hurdle rate' (_see this expression_) and 'catch-up' (_see this expression_) have been paid.
**EV**: _See_ 'Enterprise value'.
**Evergreen vehicle**: An open-ended private market investment vehicle (often a holding company), usually listed on the stock exchange. An evergreen vehicle can be a fund, a fund management company or a combination of the two.
**Exit (of an investment)**: A means by which investors in a portfolio company sell part or all of their stakes. Common means of exit are initial public offerings or trade sale to an industrial group. Other options such as secondary LBOs are becoming increasingly frequent. _See_ 'Divestment'.

**Exit multiple**: Valuation ratio set when an investor sells or divests a company or an asset (the 'exit'). It is usually computed by dividing the enterprise value of the company or asset at exit by a subtotal from its profits and losses statement (such as the EBIT, _see this expression_) or cash flow statement.
**Exit process**: Series of steps leading to the initial public offering, trade sale to a company, financial secondary sale to an investment group, sale to the management or liquidation (write-off) of a stake in a company. This therefore excludes dividend recapitalisations.
**Expansion capital**: Financing provided to a start-up company at a later stage of its development.
**F**:
**Fair market value**: Estimate of the net asset value of a fund using the assumption of what a buyer would pay in an open market operation for an asset (or a group of assets such as portfolio companies of a private market fund).
**Fair value**: Company or asset price agreed upon by willing market participants in an orderly transaction at the transaction date.
**Fairness opinion**: Evaluation given by a trusted third party on the situation and value of a portfolio or a portfolio company. This service is often used when a potential conflict of interest is perceived by a fund investor in the valuation of a portfolio or a company by a fund manager.
**Family office**: Independent and professionally managed private structure dedicated to the management of the wealth of very or ultra 'high net worth individuals' (_see this expression_) or families.
**Farmland**: Sub-category of private real-asset investing, referring to agricultural space use for raising crops or livestock.
**Fee offset mechanism**: Distributions from portfolio companies (e.g., dividends, service fees, Board attendance fees) are often not tax efficient if made to the fund. However, they are not theoretically payable to the fund manager as the latter is paid (thanks to the management fees) to manage the fund and its portfolio. The mechanism is hence set up to direct the distributions to the fund manager, and these distributions will be compensated to the fund by reduced management fees.
**Feeder fund**: Local legal structure used by investors to invest in a fund, often used for tax and regulatory purposes.
**Finder's fund**: Small fund used to source investment opportunities for the account of the investors who then usually finance the investment or the acquisition themselves directly.
**First closing**: Operation handled by a fund manager, materialising the creation of the fund and the beginning of its investment period. A fund can hold a single closing (first and final) or multiple subsequent ones, usually over a period of 12 to 18 months since the beginning of the fundraising period.
**First lien**: Highest legally enforceable claim on the collateral of a loan in case a borrower defaults.
**First round of financing**: The first investment made by external professional investors.

**First-time fund** Initial investment vehicle of a series launched by an established or emerging fund manager. The fund manager usually capitalises on a pre-existing track record, for example built in a previous institution.

**Follow-on investment** Re-investment by a venture capitalist in an existing portfolio company.

**Fonds Commun de Placement a Risque (FCPR)** Predecessor in French Law of the Fonds Professionnel de Capital Investissement. The FCPR can be 'authorised' by the French Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF, the regulator of French financial markets), 'declared' to the AMF or simply contractual. The FCPR's management company has to be duly authorised by the AMF to create such funds.

**Fonds Commun de Placement dans l'Innovation (FCPI)** French FCPR (_see this expression_) dedicated to venture capital investment and retail investors. An FCPI is created for 8 years and its fund investors are entitled to a tax break on the amount committed to the FCPI (up to a certain amount).

**Fonds d'Investissement de Proximite (FIP)** French FCPR (_see this expression_) dedicated to regional private equity investment and retail investors. A FIP is created for 8 years and its fund investors are entitled to a tax break on the amount committed to the FIP (up to a certain amount).

**Fonds Professionnel de Capital Investissement (FPCI)** Equivalent of the limited partnership in French law. The FPCI is managed by a'management company' (equivalent of the fund manager). The FPCI is contractual and does not have to be authorised by the French regulator (AMF). However, its management company has to be duly authorised by the AMF to create such funds.

**For cause** Pre-established conditions for the termination of the fund manager's mandate. These conditions usually refer to an agreed-upon level of negligence or key man clauses (_see this expression_).

**Foundation** Refers to a non-profit organisation usually created to support a specific cause. Foundations can collect capital or invest capital. In the latter case, some or all of the proceeds are then used for charitable purposes. Foundations can use their financial resources to support other organisations through donations or for their own charitable purposes. They are a legal category that notably benefits from tax incentives.

**Fund** A private market fund is an investment vehicle created to pool capital from investors and invest it in equity or debt in different companies or assets. The fund can be a registered vehicle (most of the time for tax reasons), such as a French FCPR, or a non-registered vehicle, such as a limited partnership.

**Fund administrator** Service provider in charge of the operational aspects of the management of a fund, such as handling cash inflows and outflows, calculation of fees and carried interest, and reporting.

**Fund investor** Investor in a private market fund. A fund investor is responsible for an investment in a private market fund only up to its initial commitment, not more. An investor in a limited partnership is called a 'limited partner' (LP).

**Fund management company**_See_ 'Fund manager'.

**Fund manager**: A group of principals (_see this expression_) managing a fund or a fund of funds, and by extension the staff working for these principals. If the fund is a limited partnership, the fund manager is called a 'general partner' (GP). The fund manager sources, structures, executes and monitors investments. Additional responsibilities include operational fund management, as well as reporting to and communication with fund investors.
**Fund of funds**: A financial instrument of which the purpose is to acquire stakes in private market funds. Funds of funds investing mainly in new funds are primary funds of funds. Funds of funds acquiring mainly stakes in existing funds are secondary funds of funds. Funds of funds combining primary and secondary investments are balanced funds of funds.
**Fund regulation**: Contractual agreement between investors and the fund manager of a private market fund. This agreement defines the rules governing the management of the fund, the relations between the fund and its investors and the rights and duties of the fund manager. Fund regulations are a manual of the activity of the fund in the sense that they describe all the legal elements, fees, structure and other elements agreed on by the investors and the fund manager. They can at times be amended and completed by side letters (_see this expression_). An example of fund regulation is the limited partnership agreement (_see this expression_).
**Fund secondary**: _See_ 'Secondary investing'.
**Fund size**: The sum of the commitments of all investors in a given fund.
**Fund spons**: _See_ 'Sponsor'.
**Fundraising**: A process during which the fund manager accumulates the commitment of fund investors to create a private market fund. These funds are raised from private investors, institutions and companies, which become fund investors of the fund that will be invested in by the fund manager.
**Fundraising period**: Refers to the time between the beginning of the marketing of a private market fund and its final closing. It can be as short as a few weeks and as long as 12 to 18 months.

**General partner**: _See_ 'Fund manager'.
**Goodwill**: The difference between the price of acquisition of an asset and its net market value at a given time.
**Government agencies**: Permanent or semi-permanent public organisation in charge of specific functions, established by legislation or executive powers. Their autonomy, independence and accountability can vary significantly. Their functions are normally executive and encompass financing of outside bodies or organisations supporting their goals, if necessary.
**GP-led restructuring**: Proactive liquidation of a private market fund heading towards the end of its lifespan by its manager. This involves the transfer of the remaining assets of the fund to be liquidated to a new fund managed by the same manager. This new fundis not allowed to make new investments and is purely dedicated to the management of the existing assets.

**Greenfield**: Refers to the construction of a new real asset, such as an infrastructure or a piece of real estate, on virgin land.

**Growth capital**: Financing provided by funds that are targeting companies already established on the market and which need additional financing in order to exploit growth opportunities.

**Hands on/hands off**: Depending on the degree of involvement of investors in private markets in the management of their portfolio company/assets, they can be qualified as 'hands-on' or 'hands-off' investors. A hands-on investor is generally a non-executive director on the Board of portfolio companies. A hands-off investor will have only a low degree of involvement in the management of a portfolio company. European continental laws limit the degree of involvement of a private equity investor in a portfolio company (not crossing the management line is interpreted strictly).

**Harvesting period**: _See_ 'Divestment period'.
**Hedge fund**: Alternative investment vehicle employing strategies and instruments to provide specific exposure to their investors. Managers often use derivatives to actively seek high absolute or relative returns. Hedge funds are accessible to accredited investors, are less regulated than mutual funds and are often leveraged.
**High net worth individual (HNWI)**: Natural person with a net wealth evaluated at more than USD 1 million (excluding the value of their primary residence). An alternative definition includes natural persons with a lower net wealth but earning at least USD 200,000 per year. Very high net worth individual (VHNWI) often refers to a subset of this category with a net wealth of at least USD 5 million. Ultra high net worth individual (UHNWI) refers to another subset with a net wealth of at least USD 30 million. HNWIs are deemed to be accredited investors, able to invest in private market funds.
**Historical cost**: The value of assets as shown by the financial statements of the company, but not necessarily reflecting the market value of these assets.
**HNWI**: _See_ 'High net worth individual'.
**Holding period**: Amount of time during which a portfolio company remains in the ownership of a private market fund.
**Hurdle rate**: _See_ 'Preferred rate of return'.
**I**: **ICM**: _See_ 'Index comparison method'.
**Impact investing**: Investment philosophy combining financial performance with other targets, such as social, environmental or other aims. The financial performance of impact investing is therefore usually lower than the performance of traditional investments.
**Incubators**: Structures supporting entrepreneurs or start-ups in their effort to launch their operations. They usually provide the fledgling ventures with access to operational resources, such as facilities, at low or no cost. They also foster networking opportunities, experience sharing and at times access to sources of capital. Some of them require payment for these services, in cash and/or stocks.

**Indemnification** Agreement between fund investors and the fund manager to provide security, protection and/or compensation for unplanned circumstances that might arise over the course of the partnership's duration.

**Index comparison method** Proposed in 1996 by Austin M. Long and Craig J. Nickels, this performance benchmarking approach consists of comparing private market investments or funds with an index. _Also see_ 'Public market equivalent'.

**Infrastructure** Fixed tangible assets supporting productive activities, such as roads, highways, bridges, airports, ports or networks (telecom, water, sewer systems). At times, this definition is stretched to so-called'social infrastructure' such as prison and school systems.

**Initial public offering (IPO)** First listing on a stock exchange of existing or new shares of a private company.

**Institutional buy-out (IBO)** A leveraged buy-out in which an institution is involved.

**Institutional investor** An investor, such as an investment company, insurance group, bank, pension fund, endowment or foundation, which generally manages substantial assets and benefits from a significant investment experience. In many countries, institutional investors are not protected by stock exchange regulations, as small investors are, because they are supposed to have a deep knowledge of finance and are better able to protect their own interests.

**Internal rate of return (IRR)** The discount rate which equals the future cash flows with initial investments of a project, that is to say the discount rate at which the net asset value of a project is equal to zero. This is the way to express in percentage terms the (annual) rate of return of an investment project. The calculation takes into account the amounts invested, the amounts earned and the impact of time on these operations. This measure can be net or gross of fees.

**International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines** Set of recommendations issued by a large group of international, regional, national and local private equity associations, designed to support their members in the task of valuing private market investments.

**Investee company**_See_ 'Portfolio company'.

**Investment committee** When applied to a fund manager, a group of executives deciding on behalf of a private market fund to invest in private companies or assets. When applied to an institutional investor, a group of executives deciding to invest in private market funds.

**Investment period** Initial 3- to 5-year timeframe during which a fund is allowed to make new investments. If necessary, this period can be extended, usually by 1 year, if the fund regulations allow it. After the end of the investment period, the fund is not allowed to make new investments, but can reinvest in existing portfolio companies if needed, and if the fund regulations allow it.

**Investment strategy** Rules and processes designed to support the choice of assets by an investor, usually along the lines of potential returns, risk and liquidity (or duration)dimensions. By extension, refers to unique sets of rules and processes clearly differentiated from others, such as venture capital (_see this expression_) and leveraged buy-outs (_see this expression_). An investment strategy is usually refined thanks to additional dimensions such as the maturity of the underlying asset, its industrial sector, its geographical location and the type of expected plan to be applied to it to create value and generate profit.

**Investor protection** Rules and processes designed to prevent capital providers being misled in the process of selecting assets, and therefore supporting them in preventing financial losses. This ranges from fraud prevention to the provision of certified information, and can include guarantees, warranties or insurance schemes.

**Investor(s)** _See_ 'Limited partner'.

**IPEV** _See_ 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines'.

**IPO** _See_ 'Initial public offering'.

**IRR** _See_ 'Internal rate of return'.

**J**

**J-curve** The curve generated when tracing the cash flows of a private market fund as time goes by from its inception to its liquidation has the form of a 'J'. The reason for the initial downward evolution is that the management fees and set-up costs are paid from the initial capital call, and are followed by further capital calls for management fees and investments. This means that the fund will first show negative cumulated cash flows. When the first distributions are made, the curve will change direction. After 4 to 7 years, the fund will usually break even and start to record net positive cumulated cash flows.

**Junior debt** Form of subordinated debt. The payment of its principal and interest is second to senior debt. It can be secured or not. Has priority over more subordinated forms of debt such as mezzanine debt. Usually not convertible to equity.

**K**

**Key man clause** Clause of a fund regulation stating that (a) fund manager(s) specifically named has/have to participate in the fund management. Should this/these manager(s) be impeached, the fund is prohibited from making new investments and is pursuing its activity only towards winding down.

**Key person clause** _See_ 'Key man clause'.

**L**

**Later-stage investing** Venture capital financing dedicated to the development of a start-up once it has reached a certain number of milestones, and notably to help it grow abroad, and/or by launching new products/services and/or to acquire competitors.

**Letter of confidentiality**: _See_ 'Non-disclosure agreement'.
**Letter of intent (LOI)**: The letter from an investor expressing an interest, the will or the intention to go into a form of transaction. It usually precedes the negotiation of a full agreement and is generally structured so as not to be legally binding.
**Leveraged build-up (LBU)**: An operation in which capital is provided to a holding company in order to finance the acquisition of initially one ('platform deal') and then other companies ('add-ons'). This is a source of consolidation in certain industries.
**Leveraged buy-in (LBI)**: Operation of a company by an investor, or a group of investors, through an LBO (_see this expression_) in which the investor(s) bring in new management.
**Leveraged buy-out (LBO)**: The acquisition of a company by an investor, or a group of investors, owing to a dedicated structure (holding company) and to a significant borrowed amount (generally 60-70% of the total). The debt of acquisition is then repaid from the cash flows generated by the company or the help of an asset sale. LBOs are generally financed by means of so-called 'junk bonds'. Generally, the assets of the target company are used as collateral for the debt structured by the acquire. This structuring can also be used by the management team to take control of the company it operates (management buy-out, _see this expression_).
**Leveraged loan**: Type of loan used in an LBO for highly leveraged take-overs. Considered riskier than most credit instruments. Leveraged loans are usually split and held (thus syndicated) between multiple lenders.
**Leveraged recapitalisation**: _See_ 'Dividend recapitalisation'.
**Leveraging**: Practice consisting of borrowing debt to acquire a company or an asset, in order to increase the performance of the capital also used for this acquisition. Results in increasing the risk of the capital investment.
**Lifespan of a fund**: For a closed-end (_see this expression_) fund, the start of the lifespan of a private market fund is determined by either its first or its last closing, depending on the fund regulations. The end is usually determined by the fund regulations as well, including extensions. At times, the lifespan of a closed-end private market fund can extend beyond what was planned by the fund regulations. For an evergreen (_see this expression_) fund, the lifespan starts at the creation of the structure and is indefinite.
**Limited partner**: _See_ 'Fund investor'.
**Limited partnership**: A legal structure used by most of the private market investment vehicles. A limited partnership is created for a given time. It is advised by a general partner (the fund manager that bears unlimited liabilities). The general partner manages the limited partnership according to the policy that is described in the limited partnership agreement (LPA). The limited partners are investors who have a limited responsibility and are not involved in the day-to-day activity of the limited partnership.
**Limited partnership agreement (LPA)**: Form of fund regulation (_see this expression_). The limited partnership agreement defines the relationships between the fund investors and between the general partner and the fund investors.

**Liquidation preferences** Organisation of the priority claims that shareholders might have upon exit from a private market investment. A category of shareholders might have a priority claim on getting its capital back before any other category, and at times this claim extends to a minimal return on capital as well.

**Liquidity** Degree of quickness with which a private market asset can be sold to a third party without affecting negatively the asset price.

**Listed private market fund** Investment structure listed on the stock exchange, which is most of the time evergreen (_see this expression_). This structure is dedicated to private markets (_see this expression_) investments and usually has limited or no organisational expenses. Investors in these structures theoretically have access to the proceeds (capital gains or dividends) generated by these investments. An example of a listed private market fund is the master limited partnership (_see this expression_).

**Listed private market fund managers** Private market fund managers listed on the stock exchange, theoretically providing their investors with access to the cash flow streams generated by management and other fees, as well as the carried interest of the team. Most listed private market fund managers do not hold private market assets, and therefore do not provide access to capital gains (only funds, listed or not, do).

**Living dead company**_See_ 'Zombie company'.

**Loan-to-own**_See_ 'Distressed debt investing'.

**Loan-to-value** Measure of risk that provides a lender with a ratio of the total lent divided by the value of the collateral pledged for the loan.

**Lock-up period** The time during which the shareholders of a company have agreed not to use their right to sell the shares they own in a listed company after an IPO (_see this expression_). Investment banks in charge of managing the initial public offering generally insist that the lock-up period lasts at least 180 days for the main shareholders (who own at least 1% of the capital) in order to let the floating part of the shares acquire the characteristics of a normal flotation, and notably find an equilibrium price.

**LOI**_See_ 'Letter of intent'.

**LP secondaries**_See_ 'Secondary investing'.

**LPA**_See_ 'Limited partnership agreement'.

**LPX** Sponsor of a series of indexes of listed alternative investment vehicles. By extension refers to the indexes produced, such as the LPX 50. It is in substance an index of listed financial institutions, highly correlated with the usual indexes of listed stocks.

**M**

**Majority ownership** In the case of majority control ownership, an investor or a group of investors collectively own half plus one of the political (voting) rights in a company. In the case of a simple or qualified majority, an investor or a group of investors collectively reach a pre-set threshold of political rights in a company. Thresholds are often set by the shareholders' agreement to take specific decisions.

**Management buy-in** (**MBI**) The transfer of a company where the new management team, which has control, did not work for the company before and where the current management does not necessarily have a common previous experience. The transaction

**Minimum commitment**: Lowest threshold to reach for an investor to be accepted in a private market fund.
**Minority ownership**: Literally any investor who does not reach an ownership threshold of half plus one shares. Different levels of minority ownership can be differentiated, such as a significant minority ownership or a blocking minority ownership, which entitles the owner(s) to have special rights in the shareholders' agreement.
**Minority protection rights**: Set of legal and contractual provisions protecting the minority shareholders (_see this expression_). Contractual provisions are essentially set in the shareholders' agreement, which notably defines information, monitoring, control and action rights for minority shareholders. These rights are targeted to handle relationships with other shareholders, whether minority or majority owners, as well as with the management of their investment.
**MLP**: _See_ 'Master limited partnership'.
**MOIC**: _See_ 'Multiple of invested capital'.
**Monitoring**: A process by which investors follow the actions of the portfolio company's management directed at the realisation of pre-set targets, such as sales, cash situation and (if applicable) debt service and repayment. Methods of monitoring include presence on the Board, regular reports and meetings. These methods should provide investors with a way of identifying any problems early and taking corrective action rapidly. This provides management with access to new ideas, contracts and a certain amount of help from investors.
**Monitoring fees**: To monitor and control a portfolio company, LBO fund managers can decide to charge to the company an annual fee. This fee can be attributed to the fund manager, the fund investors or shared between the fund manager and the fund investors.
**Most favoured nation clause**: Provision of a fund regulation in which the fund managers agree to automatically provide each fund investor with the best terms negotiated by any other investor in the fund, including by way of direct negotiation with the fund manager in a side letter (_see this expression_), for example.
**Multiple expansion**: One of the sources of performance generation for a private market fund. It is the difference between the entry multiple (_see this expression_) and the exit multiple (_see this expression_), and therefore can be positive or negative.

In a leveraged buy-out operation, the cash flows are a better indication than the net result of a company for an assessment of its capacity to repay its obligations towards its debtors.
**Net debt**: Total value of the liabilities of a company minus the available cash and cash equivalent.
**Net present value**: The actual value of future cash flows of an investment, less the initial investment. In theory, if the net asset value is above zero, the investment should be made.
**No fault divorce clause**: Provision of a fund regulation such as a limited partnership agreement (_see this expression_) allowing the fund investors to change the fund manager, even if the latter did not mismanage the fund.
**Non-disclosure agreement**: Legally binding document between two economic agents, which agree to actively not disclose and prevent the disclosure of information described and proven confidential. This document is often signed between a prospective portfolio company (represented by its management) and a VC/growth fund manager, or between a business owner and an LBO fund manager.
**Non-performing loan**: Amount due by a borrower which is not repaid and/or whose interest is not paid. The debt is in default or close to it.

**Operational improvements**: Effort of a portfolio company to increase its efficiency in sales and/or profitability.
**Opportunistic**: Theoretically, the riskiest investment strategy applied in private real estate and private infrastructure, essentially aiming to deliver capital gains to investors. Assets require significant improvements, sometimes being entirely redeveloped or repositioned. The debt used to acquire these assets is 70% or more.
**Over-commitment**: Operation leading a fund investor to promise to contribute to a private market fund a higher amount than effectively planned. The expected result is to help the fund investor deploy on a net basis more capital, if possible close to the planned target. Thus, the purpose of over-committing is to compensate the early distributions of a fund to reach a higher level of net exposure.

**Over-subscription** Situation in which demand from investors exceeds significantly the supply of a financial instrument, such as a private market fund.

**Owner buy-out (OBO)** Leveraged buy-out operated on a company by its current owner, either to get full control (exit of a co-owner), or to prepare the transition of ownership to an heir.

**P2P**_See_ 'Public-to-private transaction'.

**Paid-in** Sum of the capital called by a private market fund.

**Parallel funds** Investment vehicles set up to accommodate investors with specific legal and/or tax needs.

Some parallel funds are set up for employees or close business relations of fund managers, usually with more favourable terms than the main fund.

_Pari passu_ Latin expression referring to the equality between parties. In the context of credit, lenders whose loans have a _pari passu_ status should collect any amount on an equal footing, including in a case of insolvency.

**Partial exit** An investor receives proceeds from the exit of an investment but still remains partially invested. This happens for example during a dividend recapitalisation (_see this expression_), or when an investor sells part of its stake in a portfolio company but also keeps some of it.

**PPM**: _See_ 'Private placement memorandum'.
**PPP**: _See_ 'Public-private partnership'.
**Pre-emption right**: Shareholders have the right to maintain a certain percentage of ownership in a company by buying the pro rata of shares in the case of the issue of new shares. This can also be exercised in the case of the sale of shares to an existing shareholder, before opening the sale to third parties.
**Pre-marketing**: Series of actions undertaken by a fund manager with no actual or immediate fund to sell, aimed at testing and assessing the idea of raising a new fund with investors. This usually implies describing in broad terms the strategy, aim and operations of this new fund. This activity can be regulated in specific jurisdictions.
**Pre-money value**: The value of a company before a planned injection of capital.
**Preferred equity**: In the secondary (_see this expression_) market, tranche of financing sitting between debt and equity. This instrument is provided by a third party to an existing fund investor unable or not willing to answer current and upcoming capital calls. The third-party specialist provides the capital to answer the calls and gets some of the returns provided to the fund investor. The benefit for the fund investor is to stay invested and possibly keep the opportunity to reinvest in successor funds from the same manager. For disambiguation, _see also_ 'Preferred shares'.
**Preferred rate of return**: The minimal yearly rate of return acceptable for the investors in a private market fund, which is often set at 8% on capital invested. It is therefore calculated as an internal rate of return (_see this expression_). This rate has to be paid to investors before the 'carried interest' (_see this expression_) is paid to the fund manager.
**Preferred shares**: The class of shares which includes specific rights, not attributed to common shares, such as, for example, a preferred redemption with a guaranteed minimal multiple of investment.
**Principal**: Key executives working for the fund manager and putting in place the strategy and who can claim a portion of the carried interest.

**Private equity investing** Capital infusion in a company or its transfer of ownership, with the intention to implement a plan in this company to increase its value and eventually sell it, usually after 3 to 7 years at a significant profit. This plan is set up with the full support of the entrepreneurs/management of the firm. This investment strategy includes venture capital, growth capital, leveraged buy-out, turn-around capital and other niches such as private investment in public equities, for example.

**Private investment in public equities** (PIPE) A significant stake in a listed company is sold through a private placement (_see this expression_). This is in general linked to a capital infusion in the listed firm. This operation leads to the sale by the company of shares at a discount compared to the public price of the shares. This discount is justified by the commitment of the owner of this stake to hold the shares for a minimum amount of time, usually at least 24 to 36 months.

**Private placement** Sale of securities at arm's length, that is to say out of the stock exchange.

**Private placement memorandum** Prospectus summing up the features of a private market fund to be created.

**Private real-assets investing** Equity or debt investment in private assets, whether tangible or not, fixed or not, thus ranging from royalties to airports. The purpose of this investment strategy is to develop, structure or restructure the asset to generate a mix of dividends and capital gains. The holding period is usually 3 to 12 or even 15 years.

**Prudential ratio** A regulatory ratio that defines the quantity of capital that a bank must keep in-house in order to cover the risk of its commitments.

**Public market equivalent** Performance benchmarking method to compare the performance of a private market investment or fund with an index. Different variations exist, such as the ICM (also referred to as 'PME' or 'LN-PME') which essentially mimics the cash-flow pattern of a private market fund with an index. This method supports the comparison of the performance of a fund with equivalent investments in the index. The method has a shortcoming: if the cash distributions are significant, the index performance could be negative. The PME+ of Christophe Rouvinez and the mPME of

**Abstract**

The first step is to develop a

**Redemption**: Withdrawal of an investor from a fund. The fund pays back the capital (and distributes the eventual losses or profit associated with it) to the investor.
**Reinvestment of distributions**: Provision of fund regulations allowing the fund manager to reinvest early distributions, as long as the fund is in its investment period. The aim is to allow the fund manager to effectively invest up to 100% of the fund size, therefore compensating for the fees paid by the fund.
**Removal of fund manager**: Clause in a fund regulation leading to the replacement of the manager for cause and/or without cause.
**Replacement capital**: Financing provided by funds to buy out one or multiple shareholders. This can be the way for shareholders of a family business to sell their shares without necessarily obliging the family to lose control.
**Reporting**: Process supporting the regular and recurring information of investors by their agent. In the case of a private markets fund, the reporting is often quarterly and is a written report from the fund manager to the fund investors. In the case of a private company or asset, the reporting is from the management to the investors and can be monthly, quarterly or less frequent.
**Representations**: Series of contractual clauses usually used when a transfer of ownership of a given company or asset occurs (for example in a leveraged buy-out operation in private equity). It allows the buyer of a company to make sure that the means necessary for the company to operate belong to the latter. However, it does not cover an over- or under-valuation of the company. It is often combined with warranties.
**Residual value**: Sum of the net asset value of all the assets held by a private market fund as of date.

In the context of asset allocation, this consists of analysing macro-economic factors to draw general conclusions and build a portfolio from this analysis. The positive side of this approach is that it is systematic and theoretically sound.

**Top-line growth**: Growth of the revenues of a given company.
**Top quartile**: 25% of a sample which ranks highest according to a specific criterion, such as for example a performance metric.

**Venture debt**: Financing provided to mid- to late-stage under the form of convertible debt and complementary to equity financing. As most start-ups are usually free of debt, this type of loan is in practice senior and collateralised.
**Venture leasing**: Investments in venture capital that are linked to the leasing of equipment or other fixed assets in a technology start-up. Compared to traditional leasing contracts (generally not available for start-ups), venture leasing implies some equity kickers to compensate for the risk borne by the leaser.
**Venture philanthropy**: Subset of impact or ESG investments aimed at investing in emerging projects or companies with the purpose of achieving charitable targets, often leading to lower or no returns on investment. This approach applies venture capital techniques and criteria to select and invest in these projects and companies.

**Vulture investing**: Often confused with distressed debt or turn-around investing, this approach consists of taking control of ailing businesses with the clear target of shutting them down and selling their assets. Vulture investing thus differs from other strategies aimed at distressed businesses, as its only purpose is the liquidation of activities.
**W**: **Warranties**: Series of contractual clauses usually used when a transfer of ownership of a given company or asset occurs (e.g., in a leveraged buy-out operation in private equity). It allows the buyer of a company to make sure that there are no hidden liabilities (or at least that the buyer will not support the financial consequences of past liabilities). However, it does not cover an over- or under-valuation of the company. It can be combined with representations.
**Wash-out**: In the context of a distressed debt investment, a wash-out is the complete elimination of the current shareholders from the capitalisation table. In a more general context of capital increase, a wash-out round is when the entrepreneurs and managers of a company lose control of the firm.
**Waterfall distribution**: Mechanism attributing the cash generated by a given private market fund to its stakeholders according to priorities (e.g., refund to the fund investors and the fund manager of their initial commitments, then distribution of the hurdle rate, then distribution of the catch-up, then distribution of the profits and carried interest).
**Winding down of a fund**: Process of completely terminating the operations of a private market investment vehicle. This includes liquidating any remaining assets, liquidating escrow accounts and handling any outstanding right or duty, such as a warranty for example.
**Write down**: Accounting and reporting operation reflecting the impairment losses of a portfolio company.
**Write-off**: An action that changes the value of an asset/portfolio company to zero.
**Z**: **Zombie company**: In the context of venture and growth capital investments, these are portfolio companies which are break-even but do not provide attractive prospects for a potential buyer or listing. In the context of LBO and private debt, these are portfolio companies that generate sufficient cash flows to service their debt and operate their daily activity, but cannot repay their debt.
